We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data, which is any information that is capable of identifying you as an individual person.

Please see our Terms of Use for more information about our online terms and policies in general.

### Information we collect

We may also automatically collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Sites.

We may also automatically collect information about how you use the Sites, such as what you have searched for and viewed on the Sites. The information automatically collected may be associated with a unique identifier as well as with any other personal data you have provided.
Anduril may also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as data brokers or aggregators, in the course of its business activities including in connection with some client services. This includes demographic, professional and other information that is publicly available online, including information you choose to make public through social media platforms and other public online forums. We may combine this data with existing information we have about you or use it independently, for the purposes of our benchmarking and data analytics activities (e.g., analysis of recruiting practices across an industry, detecting fraud patterns in connection with financial transactions, foot traffic in retail environments). We will always seek to confirm that the third party has provided transparent information about its use of this data, including its disclosure to third parties like Anduril, in compliance with applicable law.


### Use of information

Anduril uses your personal data to fulfill your requests for information, process your requests to participate in
conferences and events, personalize content that you view or receive on the Sites, evaluate and improve our
services, distribute newsletters and alerts to you, recruit and evaluate job applicants, analyze the Sites’
performance and functioning, publish your letters to the editor or comments, prevent fraud, enforce our terms of
use, comply with all applicable laws and corporate reporting obligations, enforce Anduril’s agreements, and
accomplish other purposes you may initiate or request. In some situations, the collection of personal data may be
required for the operation of the Sites, or we may use it in the course of our business activities, including in
connection with some client services, for example, to provide certain services or products such as our
benchmarking products. We may combine and/or analyze personal data to evaluate and offer content and services most
relevant to you. We may keep any of your personal data on file and use it to contact you.

Anduril and its service providers may use first and third party Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies, including
web beacons, to manage our Sites and our services and collect analytics about how you use them. Anduril and its
service providers may collect information about whether you open or click any links in the knowledge, research or
event communications that we send to you. The information provided throughout this Privacy Policy about cookies

our use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.

Our Sites do not track you by collecting personal data about your online activities over time and across third
party websites or online services. Accordingly, we do not alter our data collection and use practices in response
to “do not track” signals transmitted from web browsers.

For example, Anduril receives reports on some of our mobile applications’ aggregate usage and browsing patterns, including information about the type of device used, posts accessed, and other events occurring within our apps. Anduril also receives reports on certain errors occurring within mobile applications.
In addition, our Anduril Insights app offers a personalized list of recommendations (called “Insights for you”) directing you to Anduril content that we think you will find interesting. Recommendations are based solely on what you have viewed in the Insights app. A unique user identifier that is generated by the app helps personalize your app experience and tracks the posts that you read in the app. We do not share your viewing history or trends through the Insights app with other users or any external third parties (i.e., persons or entities that are not affiliates or third party service providers of Anduril).
