Today, coupled with the birth and global domination of software, we increasingly look to technology for answers to protect us from misjudgment.\nHowever, there is a bit of humor here. As the proliferation of technology solutions shown in the chart, \"Data and the AI Landscape\" on pages 24-25 further affirms, we need context and process to make the path realistic. Illustrating that resource without calibration is nearly useless, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his famous poem, \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", writes:"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:F,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"\"Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink\""}]},{type:a,value:c}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:D,props:{id:bT},children:[{type:b,tag:n,props:{ariaHidden:q,href:"#testing-the-experts",tabIndex:r},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{className:[s,t]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:bU}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"As Kahneman and Tversky found among their highly educated audience decades ago, being surrounded by numbers is not relevant if it\"s not digestible in our daily workflow. To underline this point, Paul Slovic, a psychologist and a peer of Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, decided to evaluate the effect of information on decision-making. He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds.\nSlovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse. One might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on. (Industry examples of these types of KPI calculations are shown in the chart, \"Business KPIs: A Universal Language,\" on this page.)\nIn addition to imageking winners, the experts were asked to indicate their level of confidence in their choice. In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17 percent accurate, substantially better than the 10 percent calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19 percent, relatively in line with the outcome.\nThey were then given 10 pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received 40 pieces of information in the final round. Interestingly, while their predictive ability flatlined at the 17% accuracy level, their confidence continued to rise with the additional information to expect a 34% hit rate!\nThis has significant ramifications for our ability to use raw information often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) and untested assumptions. Unless we have disciplined consistent process with feedback loops, we risk being guilty of simply cherry-imageking data to enhance our confirmation bias--leaving us potentially wrong and extra confident about it."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:D,props:{id:bV},children:[{type:b,tag:n,props:{ariaHidden:q,href:"#can-you-ooda",tabIndex:r},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{className:[s,t]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:bl}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Thankfully for those with humility and a desire to drive consistent outperformance, the concept of feedback loops has become increasingly prevalent to digest and filter the mountain of data resources from noise into insight.\nThe U.S. military recognized realty is in a constant state of change (often in response to our own actions) and that excellence in process may be one of the few sustainable areas of persistent advantage. Based on this realization, strategy tactician John Boyd created a very straightforward framework called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.\nNow considered a foundational doctrine, it suggests that regardless of the backdrop, whomever is able to accurately observe (ingest data), orient (solve for KPIs), decide (designate the primary objective), and act (ability to execute) these steps and proceed back to the first step to observe success or failure of previous effort, will emerge victorious.

These may be seen within transaction records, email receipts, web traffic, or natural language processing queries of customer social media comments.\nThese discussions are often the same across corporate, private equity, and public equity uses, making a focus on defining, tracking, and predicting KPIs an increasingly universal language.

They are increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics.\nHow do shareholders and corporates aggregate all these views and see relative peer group rankings? There will be an increasing number of ways to address this, but the diagram,  \"A \"New Lens\" ESG Scorecard,\" on page 26 shows an aggregation platform with a single dashboard that allows for granularity in setting the exact criteria each organization wants to use for individual scores for each category of ESG. It then rolls those inputs into a total firm ranked score. This methodology provides consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders.\nCorporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund and see which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:D,props:{id:cb},children:[{type:b,tag:n,props:{ariaHidden:q,href:"#what-is-driving-the-stock",tabIndex:r},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{className:[s,t]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:K}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Here we are going to tackle one of the holy grail interest points across communities--why a stock is trading where it is!\nWe are familiar with valuation factors such as EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital, and how important positive Wall Street \"buy\" rankings might be.\nFor those unfamiliar with risk model factors from Barra or Axioma, these are basically mathematically calculated relationships to certain thematic styles such as growth, value, leverage, size and others.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand this is to think of it like nutrition labels. The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macro nutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\nIn the chart, \"Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,\" on page 27 a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 819 percent in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93 percent, and the company actually recovered 17 percent due to company-specific tailwinds. Fundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84 percent correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions.\nThink of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion. This adds tremendous granularity when coupled with equity owner investment discipline criteria or management capital allocation planning for M&A, buyback, or dividend policy."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:D,props:{id:cc},children:[{type:b,tag:n,props:{ariaHidden:q,href:"#water-water-everywhere-yet",tabIndex:r},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{className:[s,t]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:cd}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"We have discussed use cases in several components in a decision workflow, but there are many, and everyone weights them differently for different durations.
