Across industries, an organization’s Finance team should shed light on what’s happening today with revenue and other financial indicators, while also predicting what the future may hold. And they must do the same for the entire organization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, it would have been impossible to meet these expectations. Excel-driven forecasting requires herculean efforts to wrangle data and report numbers by the end of each quarter. But delivering daily insights continued to be a pipe dream for most finance teams. In the end, all that’s revealed is history, not the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese days, SaaS planning tools enable rolling forecasts and scenario modeling. This helps finance organizations understand what’s happening in the present and provides the ability to re-forecast business at a monthly cadence. But is that enough?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EData and reporting are usually locked within the SaaS tool, which means two things: 1) It’s difficult to measure in detail what’s changed between forecasts, thus stifling analyses and forward-looking insights; and 2) data can’t be shared with the broader organization, which prohibits a collective understanding across business functions and with key stakeholders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinance teams need to evolve and become strategic, data-driven superheroes across an organization’s entire business. Real-time feeds of operational data open up opportunities to be proactive rather than reactive. However, data alone will not fuel this evolution. You must also have the ability to create dynamic models that can re-forecast a multitude of indicators on a daily basis for real-time business insights. And you need to empower Finance to develop partnerships with other functions of the business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the future of Finance is data-driven strategic planning and forecasting, then what sets apart a finance organization is its investment in data science.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEmbed data scientists in your finance organization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to bring a data-driven strategy to life is to hire data scientists. I’m not talking about borrowing them from IT or resource-sharing with another group. You must bring data scientists onboard as finance team members who live and breathe finance, thus developing an understanding of the day-to-day work and pain points. Embedding data scientists means they can act as functional experts with data and with all the various aspects of finance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinancial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A). These teams, regardless of industry, are responsible for forecasting and budgeting. Data scientists who learn the intricacies of your company’s pricing structure can build a series of models that reflect FP&amp;A’s primary requirement for accurate forecasting. When data science powers forecasting, you receive immediate feedback on how revenue is tracking and can see how it’s evolving over time, which enables real-time adjustments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Snowflake, we forecast revenue daily for our usage-based pricing model because a lot of our key financial revenue metrics depend on consumption. This daily reforecasting would be impossible without data scientists who truly understand our business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECost of goods sold. Data scientists can also build models to improve financials around the cost of goods sold (COGS). Organizations that either rely on supply chains, or consume external resources in order to deliver a product or service, benefit from analyzing cost structures and margins. Since customer usage evolves over time, opportunities may exist to increase profitability by switching providers or renegotiating vendor contracts. By understanding product demand, you can generate both a revenue and a cost forecast, illuminating opportunities to lower costs, increase margins, or adjust pricing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EResearch and development (R&amp;D). In a similar manner, companies may want to conduct an R&amp;D assessment to determine whether it makes sense to develop something in-house or continue to purchase it from a third-party provider. With centralized data, data scientists can model out whether a large upfront investment will pay off and how long that payoff period will be before it yields positive financial results. Alternatively, data models can help determine whether an acquisition is a stronger maneuver in order to bring a specific capability in-house.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETax and Treasury. Companies looking to launch entities in additional countries need to be aware of tax implications. Treasury teams will want to make sure entities are properly funded, while balancing cost and revenue to ensure the right levels of taxation. Rather than make high-level assumptions, data scientists can model when and where to launch entities based on factors such as customer location, sales, and renewals, and then determine what the impact is on forecasting revenue, costs, and cash flow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProcurement. Data science can make a difference for procurement through sharing information and ensuring collaboration happens between the procurement function and teams such as IT, marketing, and sales. For example, it’s not unusual for the sales and procurement teams to be completely unaware that each is working with a common customer\u002Fvendor, which may present opportunities to negotiate better rates and terms that lower costs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPartner with functions across your organization’s business\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you embed data scientists into your finance organization, you evolve Finance into a more strategic and proactive function that can also help stakeholders throughout the business be data-driven and make better decisions. The possibilities for collaboration are endless, ranging from the identification of key metrics for individual teams to track, to determining how each team should forecast components of the business to grow and act more cost-effectively.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeyond data science, one key requirement is that the entire organization shares a single source of data and metrics. Anything less (isolated business systems, Excel spreadsheets) equates to data silos, which prohibit information and insights from being shared in real time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo promote alignment across an organization, Finance should maintain a set of data models related to bookings, revenue, costs, and other financial data sets that other teams can consume. This centralized source of shared data empowers business functions to speak the same language as the finance organization, work off the same assumptions, and drive their own analysis to improve their functional areas. The result is more effective and collaborative conversations between departments and a stronger alignment around company objectives and vision.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the faster you get feedback on these metrics you’re defining, the easier it is to reinvest more in an area that’s seeing success. If Marketing is experiencing success with a campaign that’s driving a ton of demand, that team can ask Finance for more budget, and that decision can be made in real time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESales. Alignment is especially important between functions such as Sales and Finance, where a shared responsibility exists around customer bookings. While sales may be concerned with bookings that happen this quarter or within the fiscal year, the finance organization also cares about bookings one to 10 years out since they impact cash flow. While the two functions may take different approaches and look at different horizons, it’s important to bring together and synthesize that information to build a stronger forecast and a more predictable business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEngineering. Their focus is on building new features, but the finance organization needs to know how changes pushed into production may impact the cost structure of the product. Alternatively, engineering may release new features that make the product more efficient. Finance needs to know ahead of time because these improvements may reduce consumption, which is good for customers, but may also reduce revenue, which should be adjusted for in the forecast. It’s an iterative process and reciprocal relationship between engineering and finance that requires an open line of communication and shared data models and analyses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProduct Management. Finance’s data scientists should also partner with product management to model the costs, pricing, and monetization associated with launching new features or moving into new markets. Product teams should be empowered to strategize and make decisions on their own, based on financial modeling and their own analysis. The outcome is more efficient discussions and easier decision-making during a product or executive review process because cost, revenue, margin, and pricing implications have been baked into the analysis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EInvest in the right data platform\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, a centralized, single source of truth is extremely important for sharing information across the company. From a Finance perspective, a modern cloud data platform should be the backbone that makes all of this possible. It’s the only way to centralize a huge amount of data, process it quickly, and build innovative data models to make real-time decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EScalability and performance. First and foremost, you must start with an extremely robust and scalable system that can easily ingest massive amounts of data, enable analytics to be run on that data at scale, and apply machine learning models in order to predict future business.\nNear real-time access. Rather than view a cloud data platform as a cost, it’s important to recognize the benefits received from real-time data and the speed at which data can be accessed. As a business, this power enables stronger insights and faster decision-making.\nData types. The platform must enable many different types of data to be brought together into one platform. Structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data need to be processed with speed and used as a single data set for analysis.\nData enrichment. Third-party data, such as ratings, fact sets, and industry data should be available to complement your internal data and empower richer analysis. Again, this data must join seamlessly with your internal data.\nGovernance and security. When all data is in one place, you must be able to govern who has access to it and make sure it’s extremely secure. Any time data is extracted, you should be able to see who extracted it, when, and have the ability to ask why.\nUsing a single cloud data platform goes hand-in-hand with my belief that you should limit the number of SaaS point solutions used within the company. You want everything to work together seamlessly and for all data to exist within a central repository so you have one system of truth. Every additional system adds unnecessary headaches. The fewer systems you have, the easier it is to monitor them from a security standpoint so you always know what’s going on in your internal environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWrangle data and invest in data science\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies have so much data, and much more they can access from business partners, and beyond, in the form of second- and third-party data. Many Finance organizations suffer from siloed data, and manual work is often required to get data into shape to analyze it. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges is combining ERP data with CRM data. It’s not simple or straightforward. That’s why easily centralizing data with a cloud data platform is a critical first step.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EForward-looking CFOs know that you’ll never be able to harness the power of that data unless you can predict customer usage patterns, and many other crucial business insights. That’s why focus should be placed on analyzing data in real time and investing in data scientists who can enrich forecasting and predictability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo matter what the future holds, one fact remains true for Finance organizations: you’ll always need strong accountants and financial analysts. But you’ll also need those who can build predictive models and understand systems, data, and processes to deliver you great success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{slug:"gaining-clarity-in-the-new-esg-era",description:k,title:"Gaining Clarity in the New ESG Era",isLive:f,archived:d,published:"2021-05-28T00:00:00.000Z",lead:k,isMockup:d,coverImg:l,smallimg:l,imginsert:a,insertheader:a,insertimagesource:a,alt:a,gradient:h,citation:{label:b,link:b},includebottom:d,author:{name:"Jonathan Neitzell",image:"jonathan-neitzell",bio:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fin\u002Fjon-neitzell-1ba3172\u002F",title:"Founder, Managing Partner",company:m,anduril:f},authorTwo:{name:"Bethany Schuttinga, PhD",image:"bethany-schuttinga",bio:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fin\u002Fbethany-j-schuttinga-54205716\u002F",title:"Partner, ESG Team Lead",company:m,anduril:f},tags:["ESG","KPIs","Governance"],category:"Anduril Post",pdf:a,toc:[{id:"major-forces-at-work",depth:e,text:"MAJOR FORCES AT WORK"},{id:"pillar-1-recalculating-the-cost-of-capital",depth:c,text:"PILLAR 1: RECALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL"},{id:"pillar-2-rising-regulations",depth:c,text:"PILLAR 2: RISING REGULATIONS"},{id:"pillar-3-community-activists-go-corporate",depth:c,text:"PILLAR 3: COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS GO CORPORATE"},{id:"esg-materiality-assessment-and-remediation",depth:e,text:"ESG MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION"},{id:"esg-dashboard-and-scorecard",depth:e,text:"ESG DASHBOARD AND SCORECARD"},{id:"esg-process-development-implementation-and-improvement",depth:e,text:"ESG PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVEMENT"},{id:"major-contributor-groups",depth:c,text:"MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR GROUPS"},{id:"ready-to-get-started",depth:c,text:"READY TO GET STARTED?"},{id:"appendix",depth:e,text:"APPENDIX"}],dir:i,path:"\u002Finsights\u002Fgaining-clarity-in-the-new-esg-era",extension:j,createdAt:"2021-08-19T15:41:11.796Z",updatedAt:"2021-09-02T19:52:21.355Z",readingTime:646400,bodyText:"\u003Ch1\u003EA New Era Beckons\u003C\u002Fh1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal GDP at the end of 2019 was at an all-time high, life expectancy rates and financial markets were seeing historical heights, yet these achievements have come at a price.

The impact on a firm’s cost of capital through increased efficiency, relative market share gains, lower operating cost volatility, and lower risk from regulatory penalty is growing in focus, as is the marked increase of inflows into both active and passive strategies to reward these efforts. Clients are voting with their dollars, Wall Street is listening, and the impact on corporate financial performance are just a few of the major drivers leading to an increasingly material recalculation of the cost of capital through as seen through an ESG lens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDemonstrating this, recent studies have suggested that ESG profiles can already explain as much as a 14% delta in the cost of capital between those viewed as responsible global citizens, and those lacking. As an example, a recent MSCI report, based on data from a study between Dec. 31, 2015, through Nov. 29, 2019, showed that companies’ ESG profiles correlated well with the cost of capital, including both the cost of equity and debt. Specifically, the average cost of capital for the highest-ESG-scored quintile in the MSCI World Index was 6.16%, or 39bps lower than the 6.55% for the lowest- ESG-scored quintile. For the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the differential was even higher at 103bps. .\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ECapital Markets Flows\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther evidence of this accelerating choice to make more capital available to reward perceived good actors can be seen in the record inflows into ESG and other sustainable funds globally and in the US. The commitment to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) has made great strides over the past decade and now has a growing sphere of influence across every industry. More recently, data obtained from Morningstar indicates that October, November, and December 2020 saw record global monthly ESG-related fund inflows of $35bn, $49bn, and $50bn, respectively, bringing total ESG assets under management to almost $1.7 trillion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Figure 1.

Proactive management of these financially relevant ESG risks align well with management teams, community concerns, and investor interests for less risk and higher return on investment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EESG in the Fixed Income and Equity Markets\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, fixed income portfolios have been classified by duration and credit quality.

Through this lens, investors can attempt to identify external and company specific factors that may become financially material over time. In fact, given the credit markets are roughly three times the size of equity, with broader reach across public, private and Sovereign interests – this is likely to reinforce the opportunity to broaden the implementation of use cases for ESG evaluation criteria.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Table 1, ESG Integration Impact Considerations on Equities and Fixed-Income Markets&quot; caption=&quot;https:\u002F\u002Frussellinvestments.com\u002Fus\u002Fblog\u002Fesg-considerations-infixed-income&quot; src=&quot;entities-table_ct5vrp&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPILLAR 2: RISING REGULATIONS\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EU is currently leading on the ESG disclosure front. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation was introduced in March 2021 and requires mandatory ESG disclosures from asset managers and other financial market players. In December 2020, the US Federal Reserve joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group focused on climate change risk, and in March 2021 the SEC formed a task force on climate and ESG to focus on\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Einvestment funds marketed as ESG-friendly or ‘green’. As a result, we expect that US banks may soon be asked to assess how risky their investments are to sustainability, while also increasing transparency for investors. Rules are expected to be coming soon for ESG disclosures that will force lending disclosures to incent constructive policies on climate change, among other issues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe regulatory environment is also seeing changes within the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has put plans into action recently announcing that in the area of climate change, it will elevate scrutiny over company evaluation and disclosure of ESG risks. In the crosshairs of the SEC’s newly formed “ESG Task Force“, discrepancies exist in company reports about climate risks under current rules and potential disclosure and compliance issues related to the ESG strategies of advisers and investors. Looking ahead, both the Acting Chair of the SEC and President Biden’s nominee to chair the SEC have forecasted an establishment of a mandatory, comprehensive framework for public company reporting of ESG issues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin the next 1-4 years, shareholder voting rights are anticipated to be a focus area with the SEC playing a critical role in the shareholder proposal process. Acting Chair, Allison Herren Lee, has signaled working toward additional goals that include protecting proposals from exclusion if they are related to socially significant issue (such as climate change) just because they may include items that may otherwise be evaluated as ‘ordinary business”. Rules and guidance are anticipated to clearly emphasize the importance of voting as part of funds’ and advisors’ fiduciary obligations to their clients.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stated priorities of the SEC will also include examination and enforcement with an enhanced focus on climate and ESG (similarly to how cybersecurity and fintech have been incorporated as considerations into the SEC processes due to apparent risk and impact) to ensure alignment with investor’s best interests and expectations as well as assessing firms’ business continuity plans as it relates to relevant risks associated with climate change.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPILLAR 3: COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS GO CORPORATE\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA recent survey by Allianz found that a scant 15% of Americans recognize the term “ESG”. Despite low “Brand” recognition, 79% of those same survey respondents liked the idea of investing in a company that cares about the issues ESG represents. While the younger generation is leading the ESG push (64% are more likely to make investment decisions on issues they care about), the older baby-boomer generation lean 42% in support the efforts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith nothing to lose, who wouldn’t support ESG-friendly companies? In fairness, a survey respondent pays little consequence for their answers. Yet, Millennials have broadly and consistently demonstrated a commitment to act on their views. A majority of the millennial generation believes that companies who care about social issues have better long-term success. It follows then that their lifestyle and investment decisions align with this belief.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis conscious consumer behavior among the millennial generation has influenced the investment world. According to The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2020, Millennial values will become more and more important as their purchasing power grows.

Already, several entities are issuing ranking systems including risk factors, or bond ratings, in specific categories. These entities are becoming increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies who are seeking to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics. However, very few data solutions\u002Fdashboards\u002FKPIs exist to alert asset managers, shareholders or corporate leadership of risks in real time and how these might be ranked across peer groups, or addressed for improvement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStakeholder groups who are not sure where to begin are not alone and there are processes and tools available which we believe will highlight the one interest all groups have in common: holistic value creation including top-line growth, cost reduction, regulatory and legal interventions, productivity uplift, and investment and asset optimization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnduril Partners offers the following solutions for companies and investors:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EESG MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis overall process is essential for companies to understand their organization’s current standing, identify stakeholder groups and audience, set relevant and attainable ESG goals and KPIs, and create a roadmap for achieving them. The outcomes of performing a materiality assessment will create a catalyst for company efforts to then utilize alert-based data analytics to predict changes in future major rating agencies, create feedback loops to recommend and track efforts in progress, and provide reports which can be shared with primary stakeholders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EESG DASHBOARD AND SCORECARD\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware solutions will include a customized aggregation platform with dashboards, alerts and a scorecard that allow for granularity in setting specific criteria for an organization to use to achieve individual scores within each category of ESG. Shareholders and corporates can aggregate these views and see relative peer group rankings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Many asset managers have developed scorecards similar to Table 1. Sample ESG Scorecard (below) that integrate multiple sources of inputs onto a single platform and, further consolidate raw inputs into one or two KPI’s that consolidate inputs through a manageable set of scores that reflect their preferred view.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;figure 2, Sample ESG Scorecard&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners, Equity Data Science (EDS) and MSCI&quot; src=&quot;ESG_High_Res_Scorecard&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis methodology provides a consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders. Corporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund to determine which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The creation and application of dashboards and feedback loops allow for corporate management to have immediate awareness to mitigate evolving risk. This also allows shareholders and asset managers to be in communication with corporates to determine appropriate and immediate action to respond to alerts.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companies often begin their ESG journey with a simple tracking dashboard that overlays company initiatives over regulatory guidelines. This tool serves to coordinate initiatives company-wide and provides transparency to guidelines not currently addressed. Table 2. Sample Corporate ESG Tracking Matrix (below), provides an example of a dashboard used to identify and track company ESG initiatives. The rows and columns align with the CDSB reporting framework, which is based on CRFD disclosure principles.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;figure 3, Sample Corporate ESG Initiatives Tracker&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners&quot; src=&quot;CDSB-framework_gii5mf&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EESG PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVEMENT\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnduril uses a process framework that is founded on the three pillars introduced in this document (capital, government regulation, and community stakeholders). It leverages industry best practices for decision-making and continual learning and ideally-suited to transform qualitative data into measurable KPI’s and actionable workflows that equip key decision-makers within company ESG programs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;figure 4, Process Flow for Decision-Makers&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners&quot; src=&quot;kpi-dev-process&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, we believe the three pillars of capital, government regulation, and community stakeholders have similar interests and have the opportunity to reinforce shared goals.

It does so by offering companies a framework for reporting environmental and climate information with the same rigor as financial information. In turn, this helps them to provide investors with decision-useful environmental and climate information via the mainstream corporate report, enhancing the efficient allocation of capital. Regulators also benefit from compliance-ready materials. Collectively, we aim to contribute to more sustainable economic, social, and environmental system. CDSB also hosts the TCFD Knowledge Hub on behalf of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI).
