Currently, several ranking entities and tools exist to statically assess ESG performance for private and public entities.

The impact on a firm’s cost of capital through increased efficiency, relative market share gains, lower operating cost volatility, and lower risk from regulatory penalty is growing in focus, as is the marked increase of inflows into both active and passive strategies to reward these efforts. Clients are voting with their dollars, Wall Street is listening, and the impact on corporate financial performance are just a few of the major drivers leading to an increasingly material recalculation of the cost of capital through as seen through an ESG lens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDemonstrating this, recent studies have suggested that ESG profiles can already explain as much as a 14% delta in the cost of capital between those viewed as responsible global citizens, and those lacking. As an example, a recent MSCI report, based on data from a study between Dec. 31, 2015, through Nov. 29, 2019, showed that companies’ ESG profiles correlated well with the cost of capital, including both the cost of equity and debt. Specifically, the average cost of capital for the highest-ESG-scored quintile in the MSCI World Index was 6.16%, or 39bps lower than the 6.55% for the lowest- ESG-scored quintile. For the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the differential was even higher at 103bps. .\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ECapital Markets Flows\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther evidence of this accelerating choice to make more capital available to reward perceived good actors can be seen in the record inflows into ESG and other sustainable funds globally and in the US. The commitment to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) has made great strides over the past decade and now has a growing sphere of influence across every industry. More recently, data obtained from Morningstar indicates that October, November, and December 2020 saw record global monthly ESG-related fund inflows of $35bn, $49bn, and $50bn, respectively, bringing total ESG assets under management to almost $1.7 trillion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Figure 1.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the trend towards ESG investments, with evidence pointing to increased volunteerism, social cohesion, focus on public good, and community support.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EESG &amp; Corporate Financial Performance\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between ESG and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), validating companies' efforts with sustainable business practices already in place, increasing investor interest, offering further incentive and catalyst for digital initiatives lowering expenses in practical areas such as paper, corresponding storage needs, cost overruns through mismanagement or miscommunication, wasted energy, as well as natural resources such as forestry, food stores, and water. Proactive management of these financially relevant ESG risks align well with management teams, community concerns, and investor interests for less risk and higher return on investment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EESG in the Fixed Income and Equity Markets\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, fixed income portfolios have been classified by duration and credit quality. ESG provides further clarity into long term sustainability metrics to bring to light issues that can have an impact on risk mitigation and the enduring success of a business. Through this lens, investors can attempt to identify external and company specific factors that may become financially material over time. In fact, given the credit markets are roughly three times the size of equity, with broader reach across public, private and Sovereign interests – this is likely to reinforce the opportunity to broaden the implementation of use cases for ESG evaluation criteria.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Table 1, ESG Integration Impact Considerations on Equities and Fixed-Income Markets&quot; caption=&quot;https:\u002F\u002Frussellinvestments.com\u002Fus\u002Fblog\u002Fesg-considerations-infixed-income&quot; src=&quot;entities-table_ct5vrp&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPILLAR 2: RISING REGULATIONS\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EU is currently leading on the ESG disclosure front. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation was introduced in March 2021 and requires mandatory ESG disclosures from asset managers and other financial market players. In December 2020, the US Federal Reserve joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group focused on climate change risk, and in March 2021 the SEC formed a task force on climate and ESG to focus on\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Einvestment funds marketed as ESG-friendly or ‘green’. As a result, we expect that US banks may soon be asked to assess how risky their investments are to sustainability, while also increasing transparency for investors. Rules are expected to be coming soon for ESG disclosures that will force lending disclosures to incent constructive policies on climate change, among other issues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe regulatory environment is also seeing changes within the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has put plans into action recently announcing that in the area of climate change, it will elevate scrutiny over company evaluation and disclosure of ESG risks. In the crosshairs of the SEC’s newly formed “ESG Task Force“, discrepancies exist in company reports about climate risks under current rules and potential disclosure and compliance issues related to the ESG strategies of advisers and investors. Looking ahead, both the Acting Chair of the SEC and President Biden’s nominee to chair the SEC have forecasted an establishment of a mandatory, comprehensive framework for public company reporting of ESG issues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin the next 1-4 years, shareholder voting rights are anticipated to be a focus area with the SEC playing a critical role in the shareholder proposal process. Acting Chair, Allison Herren Lee, has signaled working toward additional goals that include protecting proposals from exclusion if they are related to socially significant issue (such as climate change) just because they may include items that may otherwise be evaluated as ‘ordinary business”. Rules and guidance are anticipated to clearly emphasize the importance of voting as part of funds’ and advisors’ fiduciary obligations to their clients.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stated priorities of the SEC will also include examination and enforcement with an enhanced focus on climate and ESG (similarly to how cybersecurity and fintech have been incorporated as considerations into the SEC processes due to apparent risk and impact) to ensure alignment with investor’s best interests and expectations as well as assessing firms’ business continuity plans as it relates to relevant risks associated with climate change.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPILLAR 3: COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS GO CORPORATE\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA recent survey by Allianz found that a scant 15% of Americans recognize the term “ESG”. Despite low “Brand” recognition, 79% of those same survey respondents liked the idea of investing in a company that cares about the issues ESG represents. While the younger generation is leading the ESG push (64% are more likely to make investment decisions on issues they care about), the older baby-boomer generation lean 42% in support the efforts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith nothing to lose, who wouldn’t support ESG-friendly companies? In fairness, a survey respondent pays little consequence for their answers. Yet, Millennials have broadly and consistently demonstrated a commitment to act on their views. A majority of the millennial generation believes that companies who care about social issues have better long-term success. It follows then that their lifestyle and investment decisions align with this belief.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis conscious consumer behavior among the millennial generation has influenced the investment world. According to The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2020, Millennial values will become more and more important as their purchasing power grows. Emphasizing this growing impact, by the end of 2021, millennials will represent 30% of all retail sales — an estimated $1.4 trillion a year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EANDURIL OFFERINGS\u003C\u002Fh1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the corporate, asset management, and capital allocation communities, we are early into this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and we propose shared frameworks will coalesce across the primary stakeholder pillars. Already, several entities are issuing ranking systems including risk factors, or bond ratings, in specific categories. These entities are becoming increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies who are seeking to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics.

This also allows shareholders and asset managers to be in communication with corporates to determine appropriate and immediate action to respond to alerts.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companies often begin their ESG journey with a simple tracking dashboard that overlays company initiatives over regulatory guidelines. This tool serves to coordinate initiatives company-wide and provides transparency to guidelines not currently addressed. Table 2.

We are familiar with valuation factors such as EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital, and how important positive Wall Street “buy” rankings might be. For those unfamiliar with risk model factors from Barra or Axioma, these are basically mathematically calculated relationships to certain thematic styles such as growth, value, leverage, size and others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Factor and Fundamental KPI Example&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners&quot; src=&quot;Factor_and_Fund_KPI_Example.png&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the easiest ways to understand this is to think of it like nutrition labels. The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macronutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats. In the chart above, “Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,” a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 8.19 %in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93%, and the company actually recovered 17% due to company-specific tailwinds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84% correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions. Think of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion. This adds tremendous granularity when coupled with equity owner investment discipline criteria or management capital allocation planning for M&amp;A, buyback, or dividend policy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWater, Water Everywhere, Yet…\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have discussed use cases in several components in a decision workflow, but there are many, and everyone weights them differently for different durations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERead another article in this 8 part series:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-the-importance-of-storytelling&quot;&gt;The Importance of Storytelling&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-financial-workflow&quot;&gt;Applying Process in Financial Workflow&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-questions-into-predictions&quot;&gt;Turning Questions into Predictions&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-ESG-making-good-intentions-real-through-great-process&quot;&gt;ESG: Making Good Intentions Real Through Great Process&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-what-is-driving-the-stock&quot;&gt;What is Driving the Stock?&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-blending-inputs-and-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Blending Inputs, Feedback Loops and Implementing Metrics the Matter&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-upgrading-your-roadmap&quot;&gt;Bringing it Home and Upgrading your Roadmaps&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;\u002Ful&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{slug:"separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-ESG-making-good-intentions-real-through-great-process",description:"ESG - Making Good Intentions Real Through Great Process",title:"Part 5 in 8 part series - Separating the Wheat from the Chaff",isLive:d,archived:c,published:"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z",lead:"What does best practice look like to quantify qualitative efforts?

They need a story.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECall it the “human experience side” of AI if you like.

Within studies on highly educated, scientifically disciplined professionals holding doctorates in medicine and statistics, Tversky and Kahneman found that most people walk around with mental heuristics (habits) including availability, representativeness, and anchoring. Their research indicated that all humans are prone to using recent availability or representativeness of personal experience to extrapolate probability, and our expectations can be anchored by the order in which we receive information — a humbling and troubling proposition. Many of us have seen this play out in corporate life, where diversity and meritocracy of ideas are often undercut by narrative shift, hindsight bias, and the poisoned wells of personality politics burying minority viewpoints calling for objective decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir groundbreaking findings were published in 1974 in a paper called “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases”. Today, coupled with the birth and global domination of software, we increasingly look to technology for answers to protect us from misjudgment. However, there is a bit of humor here. As the proliferation of technology solutions further affirms, we need context and process to make the path realistic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the famous poem, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” points out, a resource without calibration is nearly useless. “Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink…,” poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote. Testing the experts, as Kahneman and Tversky found among their highly educated subjects decades ago, and being surrounded by numbers, is not relevant if it’s not digestible in our daily workflow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo underline this point, Paul Slovic — a psychologist and a peer of Kahneman — decided to evaluate the effect of information on decision-making. He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds. Slovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Business KPIs: A Universal Language&quot; caption=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners&quot; src=&quot;Business_KPIs_h4p5od.png&quot; alt=&quot;Index&quot;&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-image&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on.

In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17% accurate, substantially better than the 10% calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19%, relatively in line with the outcome. They were then given ten pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received forty pieces of information in the final round. Interestingly, while their predictive ability flatlined at the 17% accuracy level, their confidence continued to rise with the additional information to expect a 34% hit rate!\nstory\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis example shows significant ramifications in our human ability to use raw information often driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and untested assumptions. When blending qualitative and quantitative inputs, senior voices must be aware of the dominant heuristics and bias that may be present and must create pathways and processes for feedback loops to encourage input coming from junior employees, minority voices, and introverted personalities. Failure to include these additional inputs may be a travesty and lost opportunity for organizations who desire to grow and improve. Unless we have a disciplined consistent process with feedback loops, we risk simply cherry-imageking inputs (whether qualitative or quantitative) to enhance our confirmation bias — leaving us both dangerously confident about our choices AND potentially blind to more optimal outcomes and solutions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERead another article in this 8 part series:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-the-importance-of-storytelling&quot;&gt;The Importance of Storytelling&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-financial-workflow&quot;&gt;Applying Process in Financial Workflow&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-questions-into-predictions&quot;&gt;Turning Questions into Predictions&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-ESG-making-good-intentions-real-through-great-process&quot;&gt;ESG: Making Good Intentions Real Through Great Process&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-what-is-driving-the-stock&quot;&gt;What is Driving the Stock?&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-blending-inputs-and-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Blending Inputs, Feedback Loops and Implementing Metrics the Matter&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8&lt;\u002Fstrong&gt;&lt;\u002Fspan&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;\u002Finsights\u002Fseparating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-upgrading-your-roadmap&quot;&gt;Bringing it Home and Upgrading your Roadmaps&lt;\u002Fnuxt-link&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;&lt;\u002Fli&gt;\n&lt;\u002Ful&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},{slug:"separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-introduction",description:"Designing and implementing metrics that matter",title:"Part 1 in 8 part series - Separating the Wheat from the Chaff",isLive:d,archived:c,published:"2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z",lead:"The start of an eight part series discussing unlocking the value of data.

While ESG may be a challenging priority — as we all are digesting the aftermath of Covid 19 — it is quickly rising as a broad mandate unifying many communities.

They need a story.&quot;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECall it the &quot;human experience side&quot; of AI if you like.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo ground us in reality and reasonable expectations, it helps to reflect on the early pioneers of behavioral economics, which is the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.\nWhat researchers in this area found was fascinating. During studies of even highly educated, scientifically disciplined doctorates in medicine and statistics, Tversky and Kahneman found most people walk around with mental heuristics (habits) including availability, representativeness, and anchoring. Their research indicated we are prone to using recent availability or representativeness of personal experience to extrapolate probability, and our expectations can be anchored by the order in which we receive information--a humbling and troubling proposition.\nTheir groundbreaking findings were published in a paper, &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases,&quot; in 1974. Today, coupled with the birth and global domination of software, we increasingly look to technology for answers to protect us from misjudgment.\nHowever, there is a bit of humor here. As the proliferation of technology solutions shown in the chart, &quot;Data and the AI Landscape&quot; on pages 24-25 further affirms, we need context and process to make the path realistic. Illustrating that resource without calibration is nearly useless, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his famous poem, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, writes:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&quot;Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink&quot;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ETesting the Experts\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Kahneman and Tversky found among their highly educated audience decades ago, being surrounded by numbers is not relevant if it&quot;s not digestible in our daily workflow. To underline this point, Paul Slovic, a psychologist and a peer of Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, decided to evaluate the effect of information on decision-making. He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds.\nSlovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse. One might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on. (Industry examples of these types of KPI calculations are shown in the chart, &quot;Business KPIs: A Universal Language,&quot; on this page.)\nIn addition to imageking winners, the experts were asked to indicate their level of confidence in their choice. In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17 percent accurate, substantially better than the 10 percent calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19 percent, relatively in line with the outcome.\nThey were then given 10 pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received 40 pieces of information in the final round. Interestingly, while their predictive ability flatlined at the 17% accuracy level, their confidence continued to rise with the additional information to expect a 34% hit rate!\nThis has significant ramifications for our ability to use raw information often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) and untested assumptions. Unless we have disciplined consistent process with feedback loops, we risk being guilty of simply cherry-imageking data to enhance our confirmation bias--leaving us potentially wrong and extra confident about it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECan You OODA?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThankfully for those with humility and a desire to drive consistent outperformance, the concept of feedback loops has become increasingly prevalent to digest and filter the mountain of data resources from noise into insight.\nThe U.S. military recognized realty is in a constant state of change (often in response to our own actions) and that excellence in process may be one of the few sustainable areas of persistent advantage. Based on this realization, strategy tactician John Boyd created a very straightforward framework called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.\nNow considered a foundational doctrine, it suggests that regardless of the backdrop, whomever is able to accurately observe (ingest data), orient (solve for KPIs), decide (designate the primary objective), and act (ability to execute) these steps and proceed back to the first step to observe success or failure of previous effort, will emerge victorious. To summarize, teams cycling well through this framework will win while opponents are choking on the noise and confusion of exponential information growth. Process matters!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EApplying Process in Financial Workflow\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can we integrate qualitative (human experience) and quantitative inputs into &quot;shared intelligence?&quot; The chart, &quot;The Fusion of Data, Discipline, and Technology,&quot; on this page demonstrates how an asset management group might add specificity to an OODA loop concept, driving decisions on which allocations to purchase, how they integrate as a portfolio, and how they might assess attribution and error rate per input function step &quot; a historical &quot;holy grail&quot; challenge.\nOn the left we have inputs such as SEC filings, internal or external analysis, industry relationships, and qualitative experiences. In the next column there are functions within systems that will change through manual or automated updates to reflect the changing reality of the world around us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EData and AI Landscape 2020\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese input names may change based on the business model, but for financial services groups, this drives top and bottom line changes to forward estimates, and areas we believe to be operational key performance indicators to the asset related business model.\nThis is then reviewed based on portfolio risk parameters that may be as simple as a gut feel (how most business is actually done) or as complex as mathematical factor models. These steps culminate in a buy or sell decision, and then the forward performance of the asset begins to show actual outcomes.\nIf our effort has been recorded, now the magic begins--we can check our initial assumptions against actuals and run feedback statistics, error rates, and increasingly complex machine learning on this real-time and growing resource of training data and intellectual property. This allows data and institutional learning to become a tangible asset!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeeling Back the Veil\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003En a moment of stark honesty, most organizations will admit they have never actually drawn out their decision process, and the few that have will tell us with some flowchart they have a process. However, if the inputs are not touching software and creating a time series of quantified changes, the effort is incredibly prone to narrative shift, hindsight bias, and lack of objectivity. Consequently, the ability for feedback loops or incremental learning will be severely compromised.\nIt has been said, if software is eating the world, models will run the world. For those humble, confident, and willing to be held accountable, the tailwinds of technology can harness this tremendous potential in transparency, scale, and continued improvement on behalf of your stakeholders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ETurning Questions into Predictions\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the largest shifts we are likely to see in team discussions during the next five years is toward analytics and data-influenced decisions. To do this, we must take our qualitative, thematic questions and turn them into key performance indicators &quot; hypotheses which can be quantified, tested, and predicted. This process entails integrating the personal experiences of business users and operators and attaching their primary metrics to data consistently available.\nFor the financial industry, analysts might answer questions about a company&quot;s equity value by inferring revenue growth based on KPIs such as new customer growth, average spend per transaction, share of industry sales, and cohorts changing purchasing locations between physical and virtual storefronts. These may be seen within transaction records, email receipts, web traffic, or natural language processing queries of customer social media comments.\nThese discussions are often the same across corporate, private equity, and public equity uses, making a focus on defining, tracking, and predicting KPIs an increasingly universal language. Corporate intelligence and investor relations groups are likely to be a vital bridge between planning for resource allocation and explaining these key components to stakeholders. Do you have the process to &quot;Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act&quot; with this secular wave?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EESG as a Use Case Example\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the asset management and capital allocation communities, but what does that really mean? We are early in this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and this is an example of a where a realistic framework might coalesce.\nStandard-setting bodies such as MSCI are issuing ranking systems such as risk factors or bond ratings in specific categories. They are increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics.\nHow do shareholders and corporates aggregate all these views and see relative peer group rankings? There will be an increasing number of ways to address this, but the diagram,  &quot;A &quot;New Lens&quot; ESG Scorecard,&quot; on page 26 shows an aggregation platform with a single dashboard that allows for granularity in setting the exact criteria each organization wants to use for individual scores for each category of ESG. It then rolls those inputs into a total firm ranked score. This methodology provides consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders.\nCorporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund and see which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat is Driving the Stock?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere we are going to tackle one of the holy grail interest points across communities--why a stock is trading where it is!\nWe are familiar with valuation factors such as EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital, and how important positive Wall Street &quot;buy&quot; rankings might be.\nFor those unfamiliar with risk model factors from Barra or Axioma, these are basically mathematically calculated relationships to certain thematic styles such as growth, value, leverage, size and others.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand this is to think of it like nutrition labels. The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macro nutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\nIn the chart, &quot;Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,&quot; on page 27 a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 819 percent in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93 percent, and the company actually recovered 17 percent due to company-specific tailwinds. Fundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84 percent correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions.\nThink of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion. This adds tremendous granularity when coupled with equity owner investment discipline criteria or management capital allocation planning for M&amp;A, buyback, or dividend policy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWater, Water Everywhere, Yet...\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have discussed use cases in several components in a decision workflow, but there are many, and everyone weights them differently for different durations. How do we blend all these inputs of different types into a system with feedback loops?\nUsing financial services as an example in the diagram, &quot;What to Do With All the KPIs,&quot; this &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; of decision inputs will not scale using Excel and PowerPoint. The difficulty is that data comes from different sources, speaking languages includ.ing near-term and long-term fundamental business model KPIs, technology requirements, math and data science integrity, historical and peer valuation, and risk factor influences.\nThere are several critical challenges here:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThese inputs are like trying to compare apples, oranges, and pears.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPer our example on the horse races, academic research shows after a certain level of inputs, analysts flatline their predictive ability (overwhelmed).\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere are almost no transparent or consistent feedback loops without a software system for tracking and monitoring. We love to talk about ML\u002FAI opportunities, but those don&quot;t exist until one has the data in a system with feedback loops.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EBringing it Home\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those interested in taking tangible steps to begin this journey, there are growing options to leverage technology and qualitative seasoned business acumen within process-driven software. This software integrates corporate intelligence and financial workflow decisions with inputs from fundamental business model views, statistical probabilities, real time nowcast data, internal analysis, and risk management into proprietary internal expected outcomes.\nWhile this can be developed from scratch internally, increasingly these capabilities have already been developed from vertically focused vendors. In the view developed for the asset management diagram, &quot;Single Pane of Glass,&quot; this allows nearly real-time integration of both existing and emerging priorities like ESG scores right into category rankings from classic financial workflow like demand-prediction, valuation, relative growth, profitability, quality and sentiment. This example rolls up into proprietary rules-based rankings scalable across all global assets consistently.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EUpgrade Your Roadmap\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, this should be a great conversation starter for asset managers, investor relations professionals, and corporate management teams--how are you ranking and prioritizing your core key performance indicators and decision processes?

It’s the only way to centralize a huge amount of data, process it quickly, and build innovative data models to make real-time decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScalability and performance.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E First and foremost, you must start with an extremely robust and scalable system that can easily ingest massive amounts of data, enable analytics to be run on that data at scale, and apply machine learning models in order to predict future business.\nNear real-time access. Rather than view a cloud data platform as a cost, it’s important to recognize the benefits received from real-time data and the speed at which data can be accessed. As a business, this power enables stronger insights and faster decision-making.\nData types. The platform must enable many different types of data to be brought together into one platform. Structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data need to be processed with speed and used as a single data set for analysis.\nData enrichment. Third-party data, such as ratings, fact sets, and industry data should be available to complement your internal data and empower richer analysis. Again, this data must join seamlessly with your internal data.\nGovernance and security. When all data is in one place, you must be able to govern who has access to it and make sure it’s extremely secure. Any time data is extracted, you should be able to see who extracted it, when, and have the ability to ask why.\nUsing a single cloud data platform goes hand-in-hand with my belief that you should limit the number of SaaS point solutions used within the company. You want everything to work together seamlessly and for all data to exist within a central repository so you have one system of truth. Every additional system adds unnecessary headaches. The fewer systems you have, the easier it is to monitor them from a security standpoint so you always know what’s going on in your internal environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWrangle data and invest in data science\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies have so much data, and much more they can access from business partners, and beyond, in the form of second- and third-party data. Many Finance organizations suffer from siloed data, and manual work is often required to get data into shape to analyze it. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges is combining ERP data with CRM data. It’s not simple or straightforward. That’s why easily centralizing data with a cloud data platform is a critical first step.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EForward-looking CFOs know that you’ll never be able to harness the power of that data unless you can predict customer usage patterns, and many other crucial business insights. That’s why focus should be placed on analyzing data in real time and investing in data scientists who can enrich forecasting and predictability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo matter what the future holds, one fact remains true for Finance organizations: you’ll always need strong accountants and financial analysts. But you’ll also need those who can build predictive models and understand systems, data, and processes to deliver you great success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"}],newsletters:[{slug:"vendor-spotlight-EDS",description:"Our vendor spotlight has turned to an up-and-coming company that has been building momentum.

Most people are familiar with Michael Lewis’ book, Moneyball, and how Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, changed baseball by using analytics to build his team and develop game-by-game rosters. In the same way, EDS gives investment managers a world-class toolbox to build an analytics-supported portfolio and to make real-time analytics-based investment decisions.\nMore formally, EDS is a modern platform for fundamental investing, providing decision-support as well as repeatable and scalable workflows across the investment process—from idea generation to portfolio construction to creating orders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;markdown-divider&gt;&lt;\u002Fmarkdown-divider&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAP:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E How did the idea or opportunity for your company about?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGM:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sandeep built one of the first decision-support platforms for Steve Galbraith at Herring Creek, beginning in 2012.
