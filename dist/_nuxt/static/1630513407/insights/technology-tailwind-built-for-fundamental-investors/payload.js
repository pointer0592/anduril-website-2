EDS is the only scalable platform purpose-built for\nfundamental investors, covering the entire Investment Life-Cycle (Pre & Post Trade), solving the pain of aggregating and\noptimizing your unique intelligence. The software solution is a decision weighting tool, able to reflect your process in\nfundamentals, conviction, valuation, real time data inputs, and risk factor analysis in precise proactive stack ranks.\nThis can be visualized for Idea Generation, Portfolio Construction and Sizing, and Risk Management. This disruptive\nPlatform-as-a-Service (PAAS) is delivered at a fraction of cost of current fragmented solutions, includes leading\ndata-sets from FactSet and MSCI Factor Data, and is secure, robust, delivered quickly and configured to client’s exact\nneeds.
