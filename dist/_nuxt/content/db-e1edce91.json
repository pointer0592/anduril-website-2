Most people are familiar with Michael Lewis’ book, Moneyball, and how Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, changed baseball by using analytics to build his team and develop game-by-game rosters. In the same way, EDS gives investment managers a world-class toolbox to build an analytics-supported portfolio and to make real-time analytics-based investment decisions.\nMore formally, EDS is a modern platform for fundamental investing, providing decision-support as well as repeatable and scalable workflows across the investment process—from idea generation to portfolio construction to creating orders.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-divider&gt;&lt;/markdown-divider&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>AP:</strong> How did the idea or opportunity for your company about?</p>\n<p><strong>GM:</strong> Sandeep built one of the first decision-support platforms for Steve Galbraith at Herring Creek, beginning in 2012. I [Greg] had witnessed industries undergo significant productivity/process improvements through the application of technology, like salesforce.com for the sales industry, and was looking for opportunities to do that for the investment firms. When Sandeep and I meet at a technology conference in 2014, it spawned what would become Equity Data Science or EDS 3 years later.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-divider&gt;&lt;/markdown-divider&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>AP:</strong> I want to get started with EDS. How long will that take before I can start using it?</p>\n<p><strong>GM:</strong> We strive to have our clients implemented quicky before any commitment is made (1 -3 months with their internal &amp; external data). As a cloud application, we on-board clients in a day or two…faster if it’s a priority. We have preconfigured data pipelines to most data storage providers, and we have integrated data feeds, such as Factset and MSCI, that can be turned on for users.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-divider mx=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;/markdown-divider&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>AP:</strong> Is there a particular feature of the EDS that has received recent attention?</p>\n<p><strong>GM:</strong> There are few, but I’ll go with our FactorsLab®. Barra Risk Factors have been around for a while, but it is a challenge to integrate them into production as a component of decision-making. Clients and prospects have found a solution in our FactorsLab®. It’s analytics and decisioning solution using MSCI’s risk factors data and can be ‘stood up’ immediately and used as a standalone screening solution or integrated into an investment process workflow, for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-divider&gt;&lt;/markdown-divider&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>AP:</strong> Your core clients have been primarily hedge funds and Asset Managers. Is there a next frontier of client for EDS?</p>\n<p><strong>GM:</strong> Yes. I expect that we will start to branch out beyond our core investment vertical in the next few years. We are already seeing interest and have clients on the corporate side. At its core, the EDS Platform is a next generation business intelligence platform that is flexible to customer requirements – making it an ideal solution for many industries who still primarily rely on excel as a mission-critical element of their business.</p>\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1630615953682},"$loki":6},{"slug":"technology-tailwind-built-for-fundamental-investors","description":"Leveraging data as investors","title":"Technology Tailwind Built for Fundamental Investors","isLive":true,"archived":false,"published":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","lead":"","isMockup":false,"coverImg":"glasses-w-screens","smallimg":"glasses-w-screens","imginsert":"","insertheader":"","insertimagesource":"","gradient":"dark","alt":"tech image","citation":null,"includebottom":false,"author":{"name":"Jonathan Neitzell","image":"jonathan-neitzell","bio":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-neitzell-1ba3172/","title":"Founder, Managing Partner","company":"Anduril Partners","anduril":true},"authorTwo":{"name":"","image":"","bio":"","title":"","company":"","anduril":null},"tags":["Data","Tech","KPIs"],"category":"News","pdf":"","toc":[{"id":"the-challenge","depth":2,"text":"The Challenge:"},{"id":"current-solutions-strained-but-technology-tailwind-suggests-opportunity","depth":2,"text":"Current Solutions Strained: but Technology Tailwind Suggests Opportunity"},{"id":"doing-it-your-way-technology-configured-for-you","depth":2,"text":"Doing it Your Way: Technology Configured For You"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Published on the EDS (Equity Data Science) website"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"the-challenge"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#the-challenge","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"The Challenge:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“I have come to believe that the hedge fund industry requires far greater scale than in the past, and that excellent fundamental investing requires quantamental sophistication and analytics,”"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{"className":["quote-citation"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"- Samantha Greenberg on her decision to close Margate and join Citadel."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The sophistication Samantha is talking about is straightforward – roughly 85% of global stored data is unstructured and\ngrowing at 30% per year (faster than any other investment input), while developed market assets with systematic\nstrategies (fundamental and quant) account for nearly 80% of total volumes.

While ESG may be a challenging priority — as we all are digesting the aftermath of Covid 19 — it is quickly rising as a broad mandate unifying many communities. Adapting to this growing momentum will depend on the ability of each business to prioritize sustainability goals, accelerate digital transformation, and formalize family governance.</p>\n<p>In a newly released report from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/familybusinesssurvey&quot;&gt;PwC&lt;a&gt;, 2,801 global family business owners were surveyed. Family owned businesses overall reported general optimism despite 46% expecting sales to fall temporarily due to the pandemic. Their constructive outlook is supported by fortitude in their business’ ability to resurge in 2021 and 2022 and a growing priority for that growth to address a broadening definition of stakeholders — including profit and community. However, while 55% of family business owners can envision themselves playing a lead role on sustainability, just 37% have a defined strategy in place.</p>\n<p>In comparison to 23% of businesses in the US and 39% of the UK, Asian businesses are increasingly vocal, with 78% in Japan reporting efforts to put sustainability at the core of everything they do. Interestingly, the report cited both larger businesses, and those businesses owned by later generations, as bucking the trend with a sustainability focus well above the US industry average.</p>\n<p>Broadly, family businesses are in a unique position to succeed in ESG. Reports show over 80% proactively engaged in social activity, with philanthroimage initiatives dominating other categories. Formalizing these constructive global citizen efforts into ESG initiatives, may require relatively low effort, and will likely be strategic for family businesses to meet ‘outside expectations’ of sustainability while continuing to build generational centers of excellence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cody Nath, second generation President and CEO for &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://r-t-i.com/&quot;&gt;Refined Technologies Inc. (RTI)&lt;/a&gt; says, “As a family business, we have a long history of being committed to a wider social purpose. We are eager to continue in our work demonstrating &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://r-t-i.com/&quot;&gt;RTI's&lt;/a&gt; commitment around sustainability and wider ESG issues to our customers, stakeholders, and employees.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Katie Marshall, head of the ESG Practice at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://cruzalta.com/&quot;&gt;CruzAlta&lt;/a&gt;, a division of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://r-t-i.com/&quot;&gt;RTI&lt;/a&gt; adds, “We have an enduring commitment to making a positive impact in the communities where we live and work.

As a business, this power enables stronger insights and faster decision-making.\nData types. The platform must enable many different types of data to be brought together into one platform.

Third-party data, such as ratings, fact sets, and industry data should be available to complement your internal data and empower richer analysis.

Organizations that either rely on supply chains, or consume external resources in order to deliver a product or service, benefit from analyzing cost structures and margins. Since customer usage evolves over time, opportunities may exist to increase profitability by switching providers or renegotiating vendor contracts. By understanding product demand, you can generate both a revenue and a cost forecast, illuminating opportunities to lower costs, increase margins, or adjust pricing.\n\nResearch and development (R&D). In a similar manner, companies may want to conduct an R&D assessment to determine whether it makes sense to develop something in-house or continue to purchase it from a third-party provider. With centralized data, data scientists can model out whether a large upfront investment will pay off and how long that payoff period will be before it yields positive financial results. Alternatively, data models can help determine whether an acquisition is a stronger maneuver in order to bring a specific capability in-house.\n\nTax and Treasury. Companies looking to launch entities in additional countries need to be aware of tax implications. Treasury teams will want to make sure entities are properly funded, while balancing cost and revenue to ensure the right levels of taxation. Rather than make high-level assumptions, data scientists can model when and where to launch entities based on factors such as customer location, sales, and renewals, and then determine what the impact is on forecasting revenue, costs, and cash flow. \n\nProcurement. Data science can make a difference for procurement through sharing information and ensuring collaboration happens between the procurement function and teams such as IT, marketing, and sales. For example, it’s not unusual for the sales and procurement teams to be completely unaware that each is working with a common customer/vendor, which may present opportunities to negotiate better rates and terms that lower costs. \n\n### Partner with functions across your organization’s business\nWhen you embed data scientists into your finance organization, you evolve Finance into a more strategic and proactive function that can also help stakeholders throughout the business be data-driven and make better decisions. The possibilities for collaboration are endless, ranging from the identification of key metrics for individual teams to track, to determining how each team should forecast components of the business to grow and act more cost-effectively.\n\nBeyond data science, one key requirement is that the entire organization shares a single source of data and metrics. Anything less (isolated business systems, Excel spreadsheets) equates to data silos, which prohibit information and insights from being shared in real time. \n\nTo promote alignment across an organization, Finance should maintain a set of data models related to bookings, revenue, costs, and other financial data sets that other teams can consume. This centralized source of shared data empowers business functions to speak the same language as the finance organization, work off the same assumptions, and drive their own analysis to improve their functional areas. The result is more effective and collaborative conversations between departments and a stronger alignment around company objectives and vision.\n\nFor example, the faster you get feedback on these metrics you’re defining, the easier it is to reinvest more in an area that’s seeing success. If Marketing is experiencing success with a campaign that’s driving a ton of demand, that team can ask Finance for more budget, and that decision can be made in real time.\n\nSales. Alignment is especially important between functions such as Sales and Finance, where a shared responsibility exists around customer bookings. While sales may be concerned with bookings that happen this quarter or within the fiscal year, the finance organization also cares about bookings one to 10 years out since they impact cash flow. While the two functions may take different approaches and look at different horizons, it’s important to bring together and synthesize that information to build a stronger forecast and a more predictable business.\n\nEngineering. Their focus is on building new features, but the finance organization needs to know how changes pushed into production may impact the cost structure of the product. Alternatively, engineering may release new features that make the product more efficient. Finance needs to know ahead of time because these improvements may reduce consumption, which is good for customers, but may also reduce revenue, which should be adjusted for in the forecast. It’s an iterative process and reciprocal relationship between engineering and finance that requires an open line of communication and shared data models and analyses.\n\nProduct Management. Finance’s data scientists should also partner with product management to model the costs, pricing, and monetization associated with launching new features or moving into new markets. Product teams should be empowered to strategize and make decisions on their own, based on financial modeling and their own analysis. The outcome is more efficient discussions and easier decision-making during a product or executive review process because cost, revenue, margin, and pricing implications have been baked into the analysis.\n\n### Invest in the right data platform\nAs mentioned above, a centralized, single source of truth is extremely important for sharing information across the company. From a Finance perspective, a modern cloud data platform should be the backbone that makes all of this possible. It’s the only way to centralize a huge amount of data, process it quickly, and build innovative data models to make real-time decisions. \n\nScalability and performance. First and foremost, you must start with an extremely robust and scalable system that can easily ingest massive amounts of data, enable analytics to be run on that data at scale, and apply machine learning models in order to predict future business.\nNear real-time access. Rather than view a cloud data platform as a cost, it’s important to recognize the benefits received from real-time data and the speed at which data can be accessed. As a business, this power enables stronger insights and faster decision-making.\nData types. The platform must enable many different types of data to be brought together into one platform. Structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data need to be processed with speed and used as a single data set for analysis. \nData enrichment. Third-party data, such as ratings, fact sets, and industry data should be available to complement your internal data and empower richer analysis. Again, this data must join seamlessly with your internal data. \nGovernance and security. When all data is in one place, you must be able to govern who has access to it and make sure it’s extremely secure. Any time data is extracted, you should be able to see who extracted it, when, and have the ability to ask why. \nUsing a single cloud data platform goes hand-in-hand with my belief that you should limit the number of SaaS point solutions used within the company. You want everything to work together seamlessly and for all data to exist within a central repository so you have one system of truth. Every additional system adds unnecessary headaches. The fewer systems you have, the easier it is to monitor them from a security standpoint so you always know what’s going on in your internal environment.\n\n### Wrangle data and invest in data science\nCompanies have so much data, and much more they can access from business partners, and beyond, in the form of second- and third-party data. Many Finance organizations suffer from siloed data, and manual work is often required to get data into shape to analyze it. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges is combining ERP data with CRM data. It’s not simple or straightforward. That’s why easily centralizing data with a cloud data platform is a critical first step.\n\nForward-looking CFOs know that you’ll never be able to harness the power of that data unless you can predict customer usage patterns, and many other crucial business insights. That’s why focus should be placed on analyzing data in real time and investing in data scientists who can enrich forecasting and predictability. \n\nNo matter what the future holds, one fact remains true for Finance organizations: you’ll always need strong accountants and financial analysts. But you’ll also need those who can build predictive models and understand systems, data, and processes to deliver you great success.\n","dir":"/insights","path":"/insights/data-science-the-future-of-corporate-finance","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-08-30T19:32:58.844Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T17:16:16.555Z","readingTime":370200,"bodyText":"<h1>Data Science - The Future of Corporate Finance</h1>\n<p>original article: https://www.snowflake.com/blog/data-science-the-future-of-corporate-finance/</p>\n<p>Corporate finance must change. Across industries, an organization’s Finance team should shed light on what’s happening today with revenue and other financial indicators, while also predicting what the future may hold. And they must do the same for the entire organization.</p>\n<p>Until recently, it would have been impossible to meet these expectations. Excel-driven forecasting requires herculean efforts to wrangle data and report numbers by the end of each quarter. But delivering daily insights continued to be a pipe dream for most finance teams. In the end, all that’s revealed is history, not the future.</p>\n<p>These days, SaaS planning tools enable rolling forecasts and scenario modeling. This helps finance organizations understand what’s happening in the present and provides the ability to re-forecast business at a monthly cadence. But is that enough?</p>\n<p>Data and reporting are usually locked within the SaaS tool, which means two things: 1) It’s difficult to measure in detail what’s changed between forecasts, thus stifling analyses and forward-looking insights; and 2) data can’t be shared with the broader organization, which prohibits a collective understanding across business functions and with key stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Finance teams need to evolve and become strategic, data-driven superheroes across an organization’s entire business. Real-time feeds of operational data open up opportunities to be proactive rather than reactive. However, data alone will not fuel this evolution. You must also have the ability to create dynamic models that can re-forecast a multitude of indicators on a daily basis for real-time business insights. And you need to empower Finance to develop partnerships with other functions of the business.</p>\n<p>If the future of Finance is data-driven strategic planning and forecasting, then what sets apart a finance organization is its investment in data science.</p>\n<h3>Embed data scientists in your finance organization</h3>\n<p>The best way to bring a data-driven strategy to life is to hire data scientists. I’m not talking about borrowing them from IT or resource-sharing with another group. You must bring data scientists onboard as finance team members who live and breathe finance, thus developing an understanding of the day-to-day work and pain points. Embedding data scientists means they can act as functional experts with data and with all the various aspects of finance.</p>\n<p>Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A). These teams, regardless of industry, are responsible for forecasting and budgeting. Data scientists who learn the intricacies of your company’s pricing structure can build a series of models that reflect FP&amp;A’s primary requirement for accurate forecasting. When data science powers forecasting, you receive immediate feedback on how revenue is tracking and can see how it’s evolving over time, which enables real-time adjustments.</p>\n<p>At Snowflake, we forecast revenue daily for our usage-based pricing model because a lot of our key financial revenue metrics depend on consumption. This daily reforecasting would be impossible without data scientists who truly understand our business.</p>\n<p>Cost of goods sold. Data scientists can also build models to improve financials around the cost of goods sold (COGS).

As an example of applied process amidst an ever acting and reacting competitive environment, the U.S. military recognized that excellence in process may be one of the few sustainable areas of persistent advantage.</p>\n<p>Based on this realization, strategy tactician John Boyd created a straightforward framework called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. Now considered a foundational doctrine, it suggests that regardless of the backdrop, one must quickly and accurately:</p>\n<p>&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Observe (ingest data)&lt;/li&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;li&gt;Orient (solve for key performance indicators — KPIs)&lt;/li&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;li&gt;Decide (agree on primary objectives)&lt;/li&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;li&gt;Act (able to execute)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</p>\n<p>This framework hypothesis suggests the team most successfully cycling through this framework will learn and win while opponents are choking on the noise and confusion of exponential information growth. Process matters!</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;The Fusion of Data, Discipline, and Technology&quot; caption=&quot;Anduril Partners&quot; src=&quot;kpi-dev-process&quot;&gt;&lt;/markdown-image&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Applying Process in Financial Workflow</strong></p>\n<p>For integration into our daily workflow, how can we integrate qualitative (human experience) and quantitative inputs into “shared intelligence?” The chart above, “The Fusion of Data, Discipline, and Technology” demonstrates how an asset management group might add specificity to an OODA loop concept, driving decisions on which allocations to purchase, how they integrate as a portfolio, and how they might assess attribution and error rate per input function step — a historical “holy grail” challenge.</p>\n<p>On the left in the diagram we have inputs such as SEC filings, internal or external analysis, industry relationships, and qualitative experiences. In the next column there are functions within systems that will change through manual or automated updates to reflect the changing reality of the world around us. These input names may change based on the business model, but for financial services groups, this drives top and bottom line changes to forward estimates and areas we believe to be operational KPIs to the asset related business model. This is then reviewed based on portfolio risk parameters that may be as simple as a gut feel (how most of business is actually done) or as complex as mathematical factor models.</p>\n<p>These steps culminate in a buy or sell decision and then the forward performance of the asset begins to show actual outcomes. If our effort has been recorded in software, now the magic begins — we can check our initial assumptions against actuals and run feedback statistics, error rates, and increasingly complex machine learning on this real-time and growing resource of training data and intellectual property.

These may be seen within transaction records, email receipts, web traffic, or natural language processing queries of customer social media comments.</p>\n<p>These discussions are often the same across corporate, private equity, and public equity uses, making a focus on defining, tracking, and predicting KPIs an increasingly universal language. Corporate intelligence and investor relations groups are likely to be a vital bridge between planning for resource allocation and explaining these key components to stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Read another article in this 8 part series:</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-the-importance-of-storytelling&quot;&gt;The Importance of Storytelling&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-financial-workflow&quot;&gt;Applying Process in Financial Workflow&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-questions-into-predictions&quot;&gt;Turning Questions into Predictions&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-ESG-making-good-intentions-real-through-great-process&quot;&gt;ESG: Making Good Intentions Real Through Great Process&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-what-is-driving-the-stock&quot;&gt;What is Driving the Stock?&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-blending-inputs-and-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Blending Inputs, Feedback Loops and Implementing Metrics the Matter&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;nuxt-link to=&quot;/insights/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-upgrading-your-roadmap&quot;&gt;Bringing it Home and Upgrading your Roadmaps&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</p>\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1630615953872},"$loki":18},{"slug":"separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff-series-the-importance-of-storytelling","description":"Outlaw Blind Bias - Invest in Process","title":"Part 2 in 8 part series - Separating the Wheat from the Chaff","isLive":true,"archived":false,"published":"2021-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","lead":"Exploring the risks of blind bias from the noise of inputs and/or lack of transparent feedback loops.

We are early in this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and this is an example of a where a realistic framework might coalesce.\nStandard-setting bodies such as MSCI are issuing ranking systems such as risk factors or bond ratings in specific categories. They are increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics.\nHow do shareholders and corporates aggregate all these views and see relative peer group rankings? There will be an increasing number of ways to address this, but the diagram,  \"A \"New Lens\" ESG Scorecard,\" on page 26 shows an aggregation platform with a single dashboard that allows for granularity in setting the exact criteria each organization wants to use for individual scores for each category of ESG. It then rolls those inputs into a total firm ranked score. This methodology provides consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders.\nCorporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund and see which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are.\n\n### What is Driving the Stock?\n\nHere we are going to tackle one of the holy grail interest points across communities--why a stock is trading where it is!\nWe are familiar with valuation factors such as EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital, and how important positive Wall Street \"buy\" rankings might be.\nFor those unfamiliar with risk model factors from Barra or Axioma, these are basically mathematically calculated relationships to certain thematic styles such as growth, value, leverage, size and others.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand this is to think of it like nutrition labels. The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macro nutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\nIn the chart, \"Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,\" on page 27 a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 819 percent in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93 percent, and the company actually recovered 17 percent due to company-specific tailwinds. Fundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84 percent correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions.\nThink of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion. This adds tremendous granularity when coupled with equity owner investment discipline criteria or management capital allocation planning for M&A, buyback, or dividend policy.\n\n### Water, Water Everywhere, Yet...\n\nWe have discussed use cases in several components in a decision workflow, but there are many, and everyone weights them differently for different durations. How do we blend all these inputs of different types into a system with feedback loops?\nUsing financial services as an example in the diagram, \"What to Do With All the KPIs,\" this \"Tower of Babel\" of decision inputs will not scale using Excel and PowerPoint. The difficulty is that data comes from different sources, speaking languages includ.ing near-term and long-term fundamental business model KPIs, technology requirements, math and data science integrity, historical and peer valuation, and risk factor influences.\nThere are several critical challenges here:\n\n1. These inputs are like trying to compare apples, oranges, and pears.\n2. Per our example on the horse races, academic research shows after a certain level of inputs, analysts flatline their predictive ability (overwhelmed).\n3. There are almost no transparent or consistent feedback loops without a software system for tracking and monitoring. We love to talk about ML/AI opportunities, but those don\"t exist until one has the data in a system with feedback loops.\n\n### Bringing it Home\n\nFor those interested in taking tangible steps to begin this journey, there are growing options to leverage technology and qualitative seasoned business acumen within process-driven software. This software integrates corporate intelligence and financial workflow decisions with inputs from fundamental business model views, statistical probabilities, real time nowcast data, internal analysis, and risk management into proprietary internal expected outcomes.\nWhile this can be developed from scratch internally, increasingly these capabilities have already been developed from vertically focused vendors. In the view developed for the asset management diagram, \"Single Pane of Glass,\" this allows nearly real-time integration of both existing and emerging priorities like ESG scores right into category rankings from classic financial workflow like demand-prediction, valuation, relative growth, profitability, quality and sentiment. This example rolls up into proprietary rules-based rankings scalable across all global assets consistently.\n\n### Upgrade Your Roadmap\n\nIn conclusion, this should be a great conversation starter for asset managers, investor relations professionals, and corporate management teams--how are you ranking and prioritizing your core key performance indicators and decision processes? If this is only being done through lip service, there are bold new tools available for your transition to a process-driven approach.\n\n### About the author\n\nJonathan Neitzell is Founder and Managing Partner at Anduril Partners, an investment and advisory firm focused on the application of data-driven processes\n","dir":"/news","path":"/news/using-the-right-answers","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-08-20T11:40:20.620Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T14:44:14.143Z","readingTime":528800,"bodyText":"<p>The growth in available data and potential from analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology increases both the opportunity and the challenge for asset managers, investor relations professionals, and corporate management teams. Analytics can influence corporate decisions in product management, capital allocation, and how equity shareholders impact share pricing. The size and scope strains comprehension:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 20 billion Internet of Things devices are now online. By 2025, the number is expected to rise to 75 billion devices.</li>\n<li>There will be 4.8 billion internet users by 2022, up from 3.4 billion in 2017. 80 percent of data will be unstructured by 2025.</li>\n<li>More stored data has been created in the last two years than in the history of mankind prior to that point.</li>\n<li>Financial services firms are increasingly using this data to predict business model outcomes and set equity prices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We continue to hear these statistics, but our eyes often gloss over given the challenge of understanding the disciplines required to integrate all this data.\nWe need five skills and tools to unlock the value of this data and use it our advantage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Business knowledge of where value is created for the end customer.</li>\n<li>The devices and sources of data and their biases.</li>\n<li>Statistical and mathematical approaches to calculating what is known, and properly de.risking what is not.</li>\n<li>Technology software and architecture requirements.</li>\n<li>Cultural and organizational awareness and mutual respect for blending those respective skills into a tangible workflow.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thankfully, just as we saw with public cloud adoption, new &quot;no code&quot; tools and services are becoming available to make the scale and transparency of technology magic available to the business user who understands the core value proposition.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology calls the knowledge made possible by this technology &quot;shared intelligence&quot; Early adopters have the opportunity to separate from the pack as Amazon did with its public cloud computing service and successful e-commerce businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic creates a further imperative to take action on these types of opportunities.</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Storytelling</h3>\n<p>Even with advanced technology that can synthesize and deliver data in actionable formats, further context and understanding is still needed.\nAs Nobel Prize winners Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, were quoted as saying in the book,&quot;The Undoing Project,&quot; by Michael Lewis,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Call it the &quot;human experience side&quot; of AI if you like.</p>\n<p>To ground us in reality and reasonable expectations, it helps to reflect on the early pioneers of behavioral economics, which is the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.\nWhat researchers in this area found was fascinating. During studies of even highly educated, scientifically disciplined doctorates in medicine and statistics, Tversky and Kahneman found most people walk around with mental heuristics (habits) including availability, representativeness, and anchoring. Their research indicated we are prone to using recent availability or representativeness of personal experience to extrapolate probability, and our expectations can be anchored by the order in which we receive information--a humbling and troubling proposition.\nTheir groundbreaking findings were published in a paper, &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases,&quot; in 1974. Today, coupled with the birth and global domination of software, we increasingly look to technology for answers to protect us from misjudgment.\nHowever, there is a bit of humor here. As the proliferation of technology solutions shown in the chart, &quot;Data and the AI Landscape&quot; on pages 24-25 further affirms, we need context and process to make the path realistic. Illustrating that resource without calibration is nearly useless, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his famous poem, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Testing the Experts</h3>\n<p>As Kahneman and Tversky found among their highly educated audience decades ago, being surrounded by numbers is not relevant if it&quot;s not digestible in our daily workflow. To underline this point, Paul Slovic, a psychologist and a peer of Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, decided to evaluate the effect of information on decision-making. He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds.\nSlovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse. One might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on. (Industry examples of these types of KPI calculations are shown in the chart, &quot;Business KPIs: A Universal Language,&quot; on this page.)\nIn addition to imageking winners, the experts were asked to indicate their level of confidence in their choice. In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17 percent accurate, substantially better than the 10 percent calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19 percent, relatively in line with the outcome.\nThey were then given 10 pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received 40 pieces of information in the final round. Interestingly, while their predictive ability flatlined at the 17% accuracy level, their confidence continued to rise with the additional information to expect a 34% hit rate!\nThis has significant ramifications for our ability to use raw information often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) and untested assumptions. Unless we have disciplined consistent process with feedback loops, we risk being guilty of simply cherry-imageking data to enhance our confirmation bias--leaving us potentially wrong and extra confident about it.</p>\n<h3>Can You OODA?</h3>\n<p>Thankfully for those with humility and a desire to drive consistent outperformance, the concept of feedback loops has become increasingly prevalent to digest and filter the mountain of data resources from noise into insight.\nThe U.S. military recognized realty is in a constant state of change (often in response to our own actions) and that excellence in process may be one of the few sustainable areas of persistent advantage. Based on this realization, strategy tactician John Boyd created a very straightforward framework called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.\nNow considered a foundational doctrine, it suggests that regardless of the backdrop, whomever is able to accurately observe (ingest data), orient (solve for KPIs), decide (designate the primary objective), and act (ability to execute) these steps and proceed back to the first step to observe success or failure of previous effort, will emerge victorious. To summarize, teams cycling well through this framework will win while opponents are choking on the noise and confusion of exponential information growth. Process matters!</p>\n<h3>Applying Process in Financial Workflow</h3>\n<p>How can we integrate qualitative (human experience) and quantitative inputs into &quot;shared intelligence?&quot; The chart, &quot;The Fusion of Data, Discipline, and Technology,&quot; on this page demonstrates how an asset management group might add specificity to an OODA loop concept, driving decisions on which allocations to purchase, how they integrate as a portfolio, and how they might assess attribution and error rate per input function step &quot; a historical &quot;holy grail&quot; challenge.\nOn the left we have inputs such as SEC filings, internal or external analysis, industry relationships, and qualitative experiences. In the next column there are functions within systems that will change through manual or automated updates to reflect the changing reality of the world around us.</p>\n<h3>Data and AI Landscape 2020</h3>\n<p>These input names may change based on the business model, but for financial services groups, this drives top and bottom line changes to forward estimates, and areas we believe to be operational key performance indicators to the asset related business model.\nThis is then reviewed based on portfolio risk parameters that may be as simple as a gut feel (how most business is actually done) or as complex as mathematical factor models. These steps culminate in a buy or sell decision, and then the forward performance of the asset begins to show actual outcomes.\nIf our effort has been recorded, now the magic begins--we can check our initial assumptions against actuals and run feedback statistics, error rates, and increasingly complex machine learning on this real-time and growing resource of training data and intellectual property. This allows data and institutional learning to become a tangible asset!</p>\n<h3>Peeling Back the Veil</h3>\n<p>n a moment of stark honesty, most organizations will admit they have never actually drawn out their decision process, and the few that have will tell us with some flowchart they have a process. However, if the inputs are not touching software and creating a time series of quantified changes, the effort is incredibly prone to narrative shift, hindsight bias, and lack of objectivity. Consequently, the ability for feedback loops or incremental learning will be severely compromised.\nIt has been said, if software is eating the world, models will run the world. For those humble, confident, and willing to be held accountable, the tailwinds of technology can harness this tremendous potential in transparency, scale, and continued improvement on behalf of your stakeholders.</p>\n<h3>Turning Questions into Predictions</h3>\n<p>One of the largest shifts we are likely to see in team discussions during the next five years is toward analytics and data-influenced decisions. To do this, we must take our qualitative, thematic questions and turn them into key performance indicators &quot; hypotheses which can be quantified, tested, and predicted. This process entails integrating the personal experiences of business users and operators and attaching their primary metrics to data consistently available.\nFor the financial industry, analysts might answer questions about a company&quot;s equity value by inferring revenue growth based on KPIs such as new customer growth, average spend per transaction, share of industry sales, and cohorts changing purchasing locations between physical and virtual storefronts. These may be seen within transaction records, email receipts, web traffic, or natural language processing queries of customer social media comments.\nThese discussions are often the same across corporate, private equity, and public equity uses, making a focus on defining, tracking, and predicting KPIs an increasingly universal language. Corporate intelligence and investor relations groups are likely to be a vital bridge between planning for resource allocation and explaining these key components to stakeholders. Do you have the process to &quot;Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act&quot; with this secular wave?</p>\n<h3>ESG as a Use Case Example</h3>\n<p>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the asset management and capital allocation communities, but what does that really mean?

It didn’t take long for the global pandemic to remind markets on the importance of risk management for supply chains, strained community equalities, and the importance of wellness in our priority stack.\n\nAmidst this new awareness, we believe that ‘how’ communities think about the pursuit of happiness will increasingly take into consideration the demand for a more wholistic ecosystem of stakeholders. Meanwhile, the cost of risks to this ecosystem are likely to be repriced, with action coalescing around the major components of the move towards increasing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) functions supporting a shared consciousness toward sustainability.\n\nMany would describe the ESG landscape as a blur in need of clear focus to achieve optimal outcomes for companies and investment groups. Currently, several ranking entities and tools exist to statically assess ESG performance for private and public entities. However, very few data offerings exist to alert asset managers, shareholders, or corporate leadership of risks in real time, or to offer remediation guidance. \nWe see three primary pillars within this effort: \n\n1. Recalculating the Cost of Capital: Growing relative incentives for perceived long-term constructive community efforts. \n2. Rising Regulation: Governments are taking a more active role to allocate cost of assumed long term impact in a linear fashion rather than waiting for system failure before remediation. \n3. Community Activists Go Corporate: Professional entities are responding to vocal influences (often led by the millennial generation) asserting the values of employees, consumers, local communities and making proactive adjustments to lower perceived risks and/or improve cost of capital. \n\nIn this discussion, we will propose strategies and process flow for risk mitigation and increased financial performance to offer a disciplined approach to making sustainability a tangible roadmap. We will also discuss major forces at work within each of the pillars above and identify major contributor groups for global standards and ratings. \n\n## MAJOR FORCES AT WORK\n\n### PILLAR 1: RECALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL\n\nInvestors are growing in their embrace ESG factors as an additional component to their overall investment strategy. The impact on a firm’s cost of capital through increased efficiency, relative market share gains, lower operating cost volatility, and lower risk from regulatory penalty is growing in focus, as is the marked increase of inflows into both active and passive strategies to reward these efforts. Clients are voting with their dollars, Wall Street is listening, and the impact on corporate financial performance are just a few of the major drivers leading to an increasingly material recalculation of the cost of capital through as seen through an ESG lens.\n\nDemonstrating this, recent studies have suggested that ESG profiles can already explain as much as a 14% delta in the cost of capital between those viewed as responsible global citizens, and those lacking. As an example, a recent MSCI report, based on data from a study between Dec. 31, 2015, through Nov. 29, 2019, showed that companies’ ESG profiles correlated well with the cost of capital, including both the cost of equity and debt. Specifically, the average cost of capital for the highest-ESG-scored quintile in the MSCI World Index was 6.16%, or 39bps lower than the 6.55% for the lowest- ESG-scored quintile. For the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the differential was even higher at 103bps. . \n\n#### Capital Markets Flows\n\nFurther evidence of this accelerating choice to make more capital available to reward perceived good actors can be seen in the record inflows into ESG and other sustainable funds globally and in the US. The commitment to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) has made great strides over the past decade and now has a growing sphere of influence across every industry. More recently, data obtained from Morningstar indicates that October, November, and December 2020 saw record global monthly ESG-related fund inflows of $35bn, $49bn, and $50bn, respectively, bringing total ESG assets under management to almost $1.7 trillion.\n\n\n<markdown-image title=\"Figure 1. Global Monthly Fund Flows\" src=\"Fund-Flows.6fa535c_uedphf.jpg\" caption=\"\"></markdown-image>\n\nESG-related ETFs and other passive flows represented 30% of the total flows into ESG funds (active + passive), and 21% of the total flows into the broader ETF category. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the trend towards ESG investments, with evidence pointing to increased volunteerism, social cohesion, focus on public good, and community support. \n\n#### ESG & Corporate Financial Performance\n\nOther studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between ESG and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), validating companies' efforts with sustainable business practices already in place, increasing investor interest, offering further incentive and catalyst for digital initiatives lowering expenses in practical areas such as paper, corresponding storage needs, cost overruns through mismanagement or miscommunication, wasted energy, as well as natural resources such as forestry, food stores, and water. Proactive management of these financially relevant ESG risks align well with management teams, community concerns, and investor interests for less risk and higher return on investment.\n\n#### ESG in the Fixed Income and Equity Markets\n\nHistorically, fixed income portfolios have been classified by duration and credit quality. ESG provides further clarity into long term sustainability metrics to bring to light issues that can have an impact on risk mitigation and the enduring success of a business. Through this lens, investors can attempt to identify external and company specific factors that may become financially material over time. In fact, given the credit markets are roughly three times the size of equity, with broader reach across public, private and Sovereign interests – this is likely to reinforce the opportunity to broaden the implementation of use cases for ESG evaluation criteria.\n\n<markdown-image title=\"Table 1, ESG Integration Impact Considerations on Equities and Fixed-Income Markets\" caption=\"https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/esg-considerations-infixed-income\" src=\"entities-table_ct5vrp\"></markdown-image>\n\n### PILLAR 2: RISING REGULATIONS\n\nThe EU is currently leading on the ESG disclosure front. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation was introduced in March 2021 and requires mandatory ESG disclosures from asset managers and other financial market players. In December 2020, the US Federal Reserve joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group focused on climate change risk, and in March 2021 the SEC formed a task force on climate and ESG to focus on\n\ninvestment funds marketed as ESG-friendly or ‘green’. As a result, we expect that US banks may soon be asked to assess how risky their investments are to sustainability, while also increasing transparency for investors. Rules are expected to be coming soon for ESG disclosures that will force lending disclosures to incent constructive policies on climate change, among other issues.\n\nThe regulatory environment is also seeing changes within the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has put plans into action recently announcing that in the area of climate change, it will elevate scrutiny over company evaluation and disclosure of ESG risks. In the crosshairs of the SEC’s newly formed “ESG Task Force“, discrepancies exist in company reports about climate risks under current rules and potential disclosure and compliance issues related to the ESG strategies of advisers and investors. Looking ahead, both the Acting Chair of the SEC and President Biden’s nominee to chair the SEC have forecasted an establishment of a mandatory, comprehensive framework for public company reporting of ESG issues.\n\nWithin the next 1-4 years, shareholder voting rights are anticipated to be a focus area with the SEC playing a critical role in the shareholder proposal process. Acting Chair, Allison Herren Lee, has signaled working toward additional goals that include protecting proposals from exclusion if they are related to socially significant issue (such as climate change) just because they may include items that may otherwise be evaluated as ‘ordinary business”. Rules and guidance are anticipated to clearly emphasize the importance of voting as part of funds’ and advisors’ fiduciary obligations to their clients.\n\nThe stated priorities of the SEC will also include examination and enforcement with an enhanced focus on climate and ESG (similarly to how cybersecurity and fintech have been incorporated as considerations into the SEC processes due to apparent risk and impact) to ensure alignment with investor’s best interests and expectations as well as assessing firms’ business continuity plans as it relates to relevant risks associated with climate change. \n\n### PILLAR 3: COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS GO CORPORATE \n\nA recent survey by Allianz found that a scant 15% of Americans recognize the term “ESG”. Despite low “Brand” recognition, 79% of those same survey respondents liked the idea of investing in a company that cares about the issues ESG represents. While the younger generation is leading the ESG push (64% are more likely to make investment decisions on issues they care about), the older baby-boomer generation lean 42% in support the efforts.\n\nWith nothing to lose, who wouldn’t support ESG-friendly companies? In fairness, a survey respondent pays little consequence for their answers. Yet, Millennials have broadly and consistently demonstrated a commitment to act on their views. A majority of the millennial generation believes that companies who care about social issues have better long-term success. It follows then that their lifestyle and investment decisions align with this belief.\n\nThis conscious consumer behavior among the millennial generation has influenced the investment world. According to The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2020, Millennial values will become more and more important as their purchasing power grows. Emphasizing this growing impact, by the end of 2021, millennials will represent 30% of all retail sales — an estimated $1.4 trillion a year.\n\n# ANDURIL OFFERINGS\n\nAlthough, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the corporate, asset management, and capital allocation communities, we are early into this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and we propose shared frameworks will coalesce across the primary stakeholder pillars. Already, several entities are issuing ranking systems including risk factors, or bond ratings, in specific categories. These entities are becoming increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies who are seeking to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics. However, very few data solutions/dashboards/KPIs exist to alert asset managers, shareholders or corporate leadership of risks in real time and how these might be ranked across peer groups, or addressed for improvement.\n\nStakeholder groups who are not sure where to begin are not alone and there are processes and tools available which we believe will highlight the one interest all groups have in common: holistic value creation including top-line growth, cost reduction, regulatory and legal interventions, productivity uplift, and investment and asset optimization.\n\nAnduril Partners offers the following solutions for companies and investors:\n\n## ESG MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION\n   \nThis overall process is essential for companies to understand their organization’s current standing, identify stakeholder groups and audience, set relevant and attainable ESG goals and KPIs, and create a roadmap for achieving them. The outcomes of performing a materiality assessment will create a catalyst for company efforts to then utilize alert-based data analytics to predict changes in future major rating agencies, create feedback loops to recommend and track efforts in progress, and provide reports which can be shared with primary stakeholders.\n\n## ESG DASHBOARD AND SCORECARD\n   \nSoftware solutions will include a customized aggregation platform with dashboards, alerts and a scorecard that allow for granularity in setting specific criteria for an organization to use to achieve individual scores within each category of ESG. Shareholders and corporates can aggregate these views and see relative peer group rankings.<br><br> Many asset managers have developed scorecards similar to Table 1. Sample ESG Scorecard (below) that integrate multiple sources of inputs onto a single platform and, further consolidate raw inputs into one or two KPI’s that consolidate inputs through a manageable set of scores that reflect their preferred view.\n\n<markdown-image title=\"figure 2, Sample ESG Scorecard\" caption=\"Anduril Partners, Equity Data Science (EDS) and MSCI\" src=\"ESG_High_Res_Scorecard\"></markdown-image>\n\nThis methodology provides a consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders. Corporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund to determine which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are.\n<br><br>The creation and application of dashboards and feedback loops allow for corporate management to have immediate awareness to mitigate evolving risk. This also allows shareholders and asset managers to be in communication with corporates to determine appropriate and immediate action to respond to alerts.\n<br><br>Companies often begin their ESG journey with a simple tracking dashboard that overlays company initiatives over regulatory guidelines. This tool serves to coordinate initiatives company-wide and provides transparency to guidelines not currently addressed. Table 2. Sample Corporate ESG Tracking Matrix (below), provides an example of a dashboard used to identify and track company ESG initiatives. The rows and columns align with the CDSB reporting framework, which is based on CRFD disclosure principles.\n<br><br>\n\n<markdown-image title=\"figure 3, Sample Corporate ESG Initiatives Tracker\" caption=\"Anduril Partners\" src=\"CDSB-framework_gii5mf\"></markdown-image>\n\n## ESG PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVEMENT\n\nAnduril uses a process framework that is founded on the three pillars introduced in this document (capital, government regulation, and community stakeholders). It leverages industry best practices for decision-making and continual learning and ideally-suited to transform qualitative data into measurable KPI’s and actionable workflows that equip key decision-makers within company ESG programs.\n\n<markdown-image title=\"figure 4, Process Flow for Decision-Makers\" caption=\"Anduril Partners\" src=\"kpi-dev-process\"></markdown-image>\n\nIn summary, we believe the three pillars of capital, government regulation, and community stakeholders have similar interests and have the opportunity to reinforce shared goals. Anduril appreciates the acknowledgement of the world that is, and the one we would like to help build including these categories, and currently have early reference accounts working to implement this. \n\n### MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR GROUPS\n#### DATA PROVIDERS\nESG data (also termed as non-financial data) has become big business with the demand growing exponentially.

As part of the MSCI Group, MSCI provides ESG ratings for 6000+global companies and 400,000+ equity and fixed-income securities. Rating: AAA (highest) to CCC (lowest).\n</li>\n<li>\nSustainalytics: The 2008 consolidation of DSR (Netherlands), Scores (Germany) and AIS (Spain). Sustainalytics now covers 7000+ Companies across 42 sectors and has an international presence. In July 2017, Morningstar acquired a 40% ownership stake in Sustainalytics. Rating: 100 (highest) to 0 (lowest) using sector and industry-based comparisons.\n</li>\n<li>\nRepRisk: Founded in 1998, RepRisk provides ESG reports for 84,000+ private and public companies in 34 sectors globally. Rating: AAA (highest) to D (lowest).\n</li>\n<li>\nFactSet: In October 2020, Truvalue Labs was acquired by FactSet and is now fully integrated into the FactSet platform as a premium service to expand investors’ access to meaningful ESG signals. Truvalue Labs applies artificial intelligence-driven technology to more than 20,000 public and private companies to generate ESG scores on positive and negative ESG behaviors. Truvalue Labs data is mapped to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, allowing investors to evaluate ESG risk factors. FactSet also partners with a number of leading ESG data providers on their Open:FactSet Marketplace.\n</li>\n<li>\nRefinitiv: ESG company scores are designed to transparently and objectively measure a company’s relative ESG performance, commitment and effectiveness across 10 main themes, based on publicly available and auditable data. The scores are derived from Refinitiv’s database of 450+ company-level ESG measures, of which a subset of 186 of the most comparable and material data points power the overall company assessment and scoring process. Rating: The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a stronger performance both on ESG-related disclosures and an absence of events that Refinitiv assesses as being negative for the company concerned.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n**ESG GLOBAL REPORTING AGENCIES:**\n\n<ol>\n<li>\nCDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). A global non-profit that drives companies and governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. Voted number one climate research provider by investors and working with institutional investors with assets of over US$106 trillion, they leverage investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage their environmental impacts. Over 9,600 companies with over 50% of global market capitalization disclosed environmental data through CDP in 2020. This is in addition to the hundreds of cities, states and regions who disclosed, making CDP’s platform one of the richest sources of information globally on how companies and governments are driving environmental change.\n</li>\n<li>\nClimate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB). Founded in 2007 and is an international consortium of business and environmental NGOs committed to advancing and aligning the global mainstream corporate reporting model to equate natural capital with financial capital. It does so by offering companies a framework for reporting environmental and climate information with the same rigor as financial information. In turn, this helps them to provide investors with decision-useful environmental and climate information via the mainstream corporate report, enhancing the efficient allocation of capital. Regulators also benefit from compliance-ready materials. Collectively, we aim to contribute to more sustainable economic, social, and environmental system. CDSB also hosts the TCFD Knowledge Hub on behalf of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n</li>\n<li>\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI). The independent international organization that helps businesses, governments and other organizations understand and communicate their impacts. The GRI Standards are the world’s most widely used for sustainability reporting.\n</li>\n<li>\nInternational Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). A global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the accounting profession, academia and NGOs. The coalition promotes communication about value creation as the next step in the evolution of corporate reporting. The IIRC’s vision is a world in which capital allocation and corporate behavior are aligned to the wider goals of financial stability and sustainable development through the cycle of integrated reporting and thinking.\n</li>\n<li>\nSustainability Accountability Standards Board (SASB). An independent nonprofit organization that sets standards to guide the disclosure of financially material sustainability information by companies to their investors. SASB Standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in each of 77 industries. SASB also provides education and other resources that advance the use and understanding of its Standards. \n</li>\n</ol>\n\n","dir":"/insights","path":"/insights/gaining-clarity-in-the-new-esg-era","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-08-19T15:41:11.796Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T19:52:21.355Z","readingTime":646400,"bodyText":"<h1>A New Era Beckons</h1>\n<p>Global GDP at the end of 2019 was at an all-time high, life expectancy rates and financial markets were seeing historical heights, yet these achievements have come at a price. It didn’t take long for the global pandemic to remind markets on the importance of risk management for supply chains, strained community equalities, and the importance of wellness in our priority stack.</p>\n<p>Amidst this new awareness, we believe that ‘how’ communities think about the pursuit of happiness will increasingly take into consideration the demand for a more wholistic ecosystem of stakeholders. Meanwhile, the cost of risks to this ecosystem are likely to be repriced, with action coalescing around the major components of the move towards increasing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) functions supporting a shared consciousness toward sustainability.</p>\n<p>Many would describe the ESG landscape as a blur in need of clear focus to achieve optimal outcomes for companies and investment groups. Currently, several ranking entities and tools exist to statically assess ESG performance for private and public entities. However, very few data offerings exist to alert asset managers, shareholders, or corporate leadership of risks in real time, or to offer remediation guidance.\nWe see three primary pillars within this effort:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recalculating the Cost of Capital: Growing relative incentives for perceived long-term constructive community efforts.</li>\n<li>Rising Regulation: Governments are taking a more active role to allocate cost of assumed long term impact in a linear fashion rather than waiting for system failure before remediation.</li>\n<li>Community Activists Go Corporate: Professional entities are responding to vocal influences (often led by the millennial generation) asserting the values of employees, consumers, local communities and making proactive adjustments to lower perceived risks and/or improve cost of capital.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this discussion, we will propose strategies and process flow for risk mitigation and increased financial performance to offer a disciplined approach to making sustainability a tangible roadmap. We will also discuss major forces at work within each of the pillars above and identify major contributor groups for global standards and ratings.</p>\n<h2>MAJOR FORCES AT WORK</h2>\n<h3>PILLAR 1: RECALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL</h3>\n<p>Investors are growing in their embrace ESG factors as an additional component to their overall investment strategy. The impact on a firm’s cost of capital through increased efficiency, relative market share gains, lower operating cost volatility, and lower risk from regulatory penalty is growing in focus, as is the marked increase of inflows into both active and passive strategies to reward these efforts. Clients are voting with their dollars, Wall Street is listening, and the impact on corporate financial performance are just a few of the major drivers leading to an increasingly material recalculation of the cost of capital through as seen through an ESG lens.</p>\n<p>Demonstrating this, recent studies have suggested that ESG profiles can already explain as much as a 14% delta in the cost of capital between those viewed as responsible global citizens, and those lacking. As an example, a recent MSCI report, based on data from a study between Dec. 31, 2015, through Nov. 29, 2019, showed that companies’ ESG profiles correlated well with the cost of capital, including both the cost of equity and debt. Specifically, the average cost of capital for the highest-ESG-scored quintile in the MSCI World Index was 6.16%, or 39bps lower than the 6.55% for the lowest- ESG-scored quintile. For the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the differential was even higher at 103bps. .</p>\n<h4>Capital Markets Flows</h4>\n<p>Further evidence of this accelerating choice to make more capital available to reward perceived good actors can be seen in the record inflows into ESG and other sustainable funds globally and in the US. The commitment to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) has made great strides over the past decade and now has a growing sphere of influence across every industry. More recently, data obtained from Morningstar indicates that October, November, and December 2020 saw record global monthly ESG-related fund inflows of $35bn, $49bn, and $50bn, respectively, bringing total ESG assets under management to almost $1.7 trillion.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Figure 1. Global Monthly Fund Flows&quot; src=&quot;Fund-Flows.6fa535c_uedphf.jpg&quot; caption=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/markdown-image&gt;</p>\n<p>ESG-related ETFs and other passive flows represented 30% of the total flows into ESG funds (active + passive), and 21% of the total flows into the broader ETF category. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the trend towards ESG investments, with evidence pointing to increased volunteerism, social cohesion, focus on public good, and community support.</p>\n<h4>ESG &amp; Corporate Financial Performance</h4>\n<p>Other studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between ESG and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), validating companies' efforts with sustainable business practices already in place, increasing investor interest, offering further incentive and catalyst for digital initiatives lowering expenses in practical areas such as paper, corresponding storage needs, cost overruns through mismanagement or miscommunication, wasted energy, as well as natural resources such as forestry, food stores, and water. Proactive management of these financially relevant ESG risks align well with management teams, community concerns, and investor interests for less risk and higher return on investment.</p>\n<h4>ESG in the Fixed Income and Equity Markets</h4>\n<p>Historically, fixed income portfolios have been classified by duration and credit quality. ESG provides further clarity into long term sustainability metrics to bring to light issues that can have an impact on risk mitigation and the enduring success of a business. Through this lens, investors can attempt to identify external and company specific factors that may become financially material over time. In fact, given the credit markets are roughly three times the size of equity, with broader reach across public, private and Sovereign interests – this is likely to reinforce the opportunity to broaden the implementation of use cases for ESG evaluation criteria.</p>\n<p>&lt;markdown-image title=&quot;Table 1, ESG Integration Impact Considerations on Equities and Fixed-Income Markets&quot; caption=&quot;https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/esg-considerations-infixed-income&quot; src=&quot;entities-table_ct5vrp&quot;&gt;&lt;/markdown-image&gt;</p>\n<h3>PILLAR 2: RISING REGULATIONS</h3>\n<p>The EU is currently leading on the ESG disclosure front. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation was introduced in March 2021 and requires mandatory ESG disclosures from asset managers and other financial market players. In December 2020, the US Federal Reserve joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group focused on climate change risk, and in March 2021 the SEC formed a task force on climate and ESG to focus on</p>\n<p>investment funds marketed as ESG-friendly or ‘green’. As a result, we expect that US banks may soon be asked to assess how risky their investments are to sustainability, while also increasing transparency for investors. Rules are expected to be coming soon for ESG disclosures that will force lending disclosures to incent constructive policies on climate change, among other issues.</p>\n<p>The regulatory environment is also seeing changes within the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has put plans into action recently announcing that in the area of climate change, it will elevate scrutiny over company evaluation and disclosure of ESG risks. In the crosshairs of the SEC’s newly formed “ESG Task Force“, discrepancies exist in company reports about climate risks under current rules and potential disclosure and compliance issues related to the ESG strategies of advisers and investors. Looking ahead, both the Acting Chair of the SEC and President Biden’s nominee to chair the SEC have forecasted an establishment of a mandatory, comprehensive framework for public company reporting of ESG issues.</p>\n<p>Within the next 1-4 years, shareholder voting rights are anticipated to be a focus area with the SEC playing a critical role in the shareholder proposal process. Acting Chair, Allison Herren Lee, has signaled working toward additional goals that include protecting proposals from exclusion if they are related to socially significant issue (such as climate change) just because they may include items that may otherwise be evaluated as ‘ordinary business”. Rules and guidance are anticipated to clearly emphasize the importance of voting as part of funds’ and advisors’ fiduciary obligations to their clients.</p>\n<p>The stated priorities of the SEC will also include examination and enforcement with an enhanced focus on climate and ESG (similarly to how cybersecurity and fintech have been incorporated as considerations into the SEC processes due to apparent risk and impact) to ensure alignment with investor’s best interests and expectations as well as assessing firms’ business continuity plans as it relates to relevant risks associated with climate change.</p>\n<h3>PILLAR 3: COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS GO CORPORATE</h3>\n<p>A recent survey by Allianz found that a scant 15% of Americans recognize the term “ESG”. Despite low “Brand” recognition, 79% of those same survey respondents liked the idea of investing in a company that cares about the issues ESG represents. While the younger generation is leading the ESG push (64% are more likely to make investment decisions on issues they care about), the older baby-boomer generation lean 42% in support the efforts.</p>\n<p>With nothing to lose, who wouldn’t support ESG-friendly companies? In fairness, a survey respondent pays little consequence for their answers. Yet, Millennials have broadly and consistently demonstrated a commitment to act on their views. A majority of the millennial generation believes that companies who care about social issues have better long-term success. It follows then that their lifestyle and investment decisions align with this belief.</p>\n<p>This conscious consumer behavior among the millennial generation has influenced the investment world. According to The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2020, Millennial values will become more and more important as their purchasing power grows. Emphasizing this growing impact, by the end of 2021, millennials will represent 30% of all retail sales — an estimated $1.4 trillion a year.</p>\n<h1>ANDURIL OFFERINGS</h1>\n<p>Although, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the corporate, asset management, and capital allocation communities, we are early into this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and we propose shared frameworks will coalesce across the primary stakeholder pillars.

He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds.\nSlovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse. One might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on. (Industry examples of these types of KPI calculations are shown in the chart, \"Business KPIs: A Universal Language,\" on this page.)\nIn addition to imageking winners, the experts were asked to indicate their level of confidence in their choice. In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17 percent accurate, substantially better than the 10 percent calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19 percent, relatively in line with the outcome.\nThey were then given 10 pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received 40 pieces of information in the final round.

The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macro nutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\nIn the chart, \"Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,\" on page 27 a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 819 percent in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93 percent, and the company actually recovered 17 percent due to company-specific tailwinds. Fundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84 percent correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions.\nThink of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion.

Process matters!\n\n### Applying Process in Financial Workflow\n\nHow can we integrate qualitative (human experience) and quantitative inputs into \"shared intelligence?\" The chart, \"The Fusion of Data, Discipline, and Technology,\" on this page demonstrates how an asset management group might add specificity to an OODA loop concept, driving decisions on which allocations to purchase, how they integrate as a portfolio, and how they might assess attribution and error rate per input function step \" a historical \"holy grail\" challenge.\nOn the left we have inputs such as SEC filings, internal or external analysis, industry relationships, and qualitative experiences. In the next column there are functions within systems that will change through manual or automated updates to reflect the changing reality of the world around us.\n\n### Data and AI Landscape 2020\n\nThese input names may change based on the business model, but for financial services groups, this drives top and bottom line changes to forward estimates, and areas we believe to be operational key performance indicators to the asset related business model.\nThis is then reviewed based on portfolio risk parameters that may be as simple as a gut feel (how most business is actually done) or as complex as mathematical factor models. These steps culminate in a buy or sell decision, and then the forward performance of the asset begins to show actual outcomes.\nIf our effort has been recorded, now the magic begins--we can check our initial assumptions against actuals and run feedback statistics, error rates, and increasingly complex machine learning on this real-time and growing resource of training data and intellectual property. This allows data and institutional learning to become a tangible asset!\n\n### Peeling Back the Veil\n\nn a moment of stark honesty, most organizations will admit they have never actually drawn out their decision process, and the few that have will tell us with some flowchart they have a process. However, if the inputs are not touching software and creating a time series of quantified changes, the effort is incredibly prone to narrative shift, hindsight bias, and lack of objectivity. Consequently, the ability for feedback loops or incremental learning will be severely compromised.\nIt has been said, if software is eating the world, models will run the world. For those humble, confident, and willing to be held accountable, the tailwinds of technology can harness this tremendous potential in transparency, scale, and continued improvement on behalf of your stakeholders.\n\n### Turning Questions into Predictions\n\nOne of the largest shifts we are likely to see in team discussions during the next five years is toward analytics and data-influenced decisions. To do this, we must take our qualitative, thematic questions and turn them into key performance indicators \" hypotheses which can be quantified, tested, and predicted. This process entails integrating the personal experiences of business users and operators and attaching their primary metrics to data consistently available.\nFor the financial industry, analysts might answer questions about a company\"s equity value by inferring revenue growth based on KPIs such as new customer growth, average spend per transaction, share of industry sales, and cohorts changing purchasing locations between physical and virtual storefronts. These may be seen within transaction records, email receipts, web traffic, or natural language processing queries of customer social media comments.\nThese discussions are often the same across corporate, private equity, and public equity uses, making a focus on defining, tracking, and predicting KPIs an increasingly universal language. Corporate intelligence and investor relations groups are likely to be a vital bridge between planning for resource allocation and explaining these key components to stakeholders. Do you have the process to \"Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act\" with this secular wave?\n\n### ESG as a Use Case Example\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainable investment is a rising focus across the asset management and capital allocation communities, but what does that really mean? We are early in this journey of quantifying many qualitative efforts, and this is an example of a where a realistic framework might coalesce.\nStandard-setting bodies such as MSCI are issuing ranking systems such as risk factors or bond ratings in specific categories. They are increasingly joined by broker dealers and boutique research companies to create a more consistent and transparent framework for these metrics.\nHow do shareholders and corporates aggregate all these views and see relative peer group rankings? There will be an increasing number of ways to address this, but the diagram,  \"A \"New Lens\" ESG Scorecard,\" on page 26 shows an aggregation platform with a single dashboard that allows for granularity in setting the exact criteria each organization wants to use for individual scores for each category of ESG. It then rolls those inputs into a total firm ranked score. This methodology provides consistent, scalable, real time, and transparent process to stakeholders.\nCorporations and large foundation allocators can also use this with ownership data to see what the ESG scores are for each aggregated investment fund and see which institutions are really putting their money where their claimed priorities are.\n\n### What is Driving the Stock?\n\nHere we are going to tackle one of the holy grail interest points across communities--why a stock is trading where it is!\nWe are familiar with valuation factors such as EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital, and how important positive Wall Street \"buy\" rankings might be.\nFor those unfamiliar with risk model factors from Barra or Axioma, these are basically mathematically calculated relationships to certain thematic styles such as growth, value, leverage, size and others.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand this is to think of it like nutrition labels. The impact of a food (or asset) really depends on the build of macro nutrients. Using factor analysis, we can decompose what is driving asset pricing similar to how we can deconstruct a soup into nutrition macros such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\nIn the chart, \"Factor and Fundamental KPI Example,\" on page 27 a company is compared to a group of its peers. While the stock was down 819 percent in this example, style factors negatively impacted its peer group by 25.93 percent, and the company actually recovered 17 percent due to company-specific tailwinds. Fundamentally, we can see that EBITDA margins and growth have an 84 percent correlation to stock price, demonstrating explicitly what shareholders care about most, with powerful ramifications for capital allocation decisions.\nThink of how powerful this is to know when meeting with management or shareholders and this can be explicitly and empirically answered, along with exact correlation of whether the stock has been most influenced by top[-line growth or margin expansion. This adds tremendous granularity when coupled with equity owner investment discipline criteria or management capital allocation planning for M&A, buyback, or dividend policy.\n\n### Water, Water Everywhere, Yet...\n\nWe have discussed use cases in several components in a decision workflow, but there are many, and everyone weights them differently for different durations. How do we blend all these inputs of different types into a system with feedback loops?\nUsing financial services as an example in the diagram, \"What to Do With All the KPIs,\" this \"Tower of Babel\" of decision inputs will not scale using Excel and PowerPoint. The difficulty is that data comes from different sources, speaking languages includ.ing near-term and long-term fundamental business model KPIs, technology requirements, math and data science integrity, historical and peer valuation, and risk factor influences.\nThere are several critical challenges here:\n\n1. These inputs are like trying to compare apples, oranges, and pears.\n2. Per our example on the horse races, academic research shows after a certain level of inputs, analysts flatline their predictive ability (overwhelmed).\n3. There are almost no transparent or consistent feedback loops without a software system for tracking and monitoring. We love to talk about ML/AI opportunities, but those don\"t exist until one has the data in a system with feedback loops.\n\n### Bringing it Home\n\nFor those interested in taking tangible steps to begin this journey, there are growing options to leverage technology and qualitative seasoned business acumen within process-driven software. This software integrates corporate intelligence and financial workflow decisions with inputs from fundamental business model views, statistical probabilities, real time nowcast data, internal analysis, and risk management into proprietary internal expected outcomes.\nWhile this can be developed from scratch internally, increasingly these capabilities have already been developed from vertically focused vendors. In the view developed for the asset management diagram, \"Single Pane of Glass,\" this allows nearly real-time integration of both existing and emerging priorities like ESG scores right into category rankings from classic financial workflow like demand-prediction, valuation, relative growth, profitability, quality and sentiment. This example rolls up into proprietary rules-based rankings scalable across all global assets consistently.\n\n### Upgrade Your Roadmap\n\nIn conclusion, this should be a great conversation starter for asset managers, investor relations professionals, and corporate management teams--how are you ranking and prioritizing your core key performance indicators and decision processes? If this is only being done through lip service, there are bold new tools available for your transition to a process-driven approach.\n\n### About the author\n\nJonathan Neitzell is Founder and Managing Partner at Anduril Partners, an investment and advisory firm focused on the application of data-driven processes\n","dir":"/insights","path":"/insights/using-the-right-answers","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-08-19T15:41:11.806Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T19:52:21.358Z","readingTime":528800,"bodyText":"<p>The growth in available data and potential from analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology increases both the opportunity and the challenge for asset managers, investor relations professionals, and corporate management teams. Analytics can influence corporate decisions in product management, capital allocation, and how equity shareholders impact share pricing. The size and scope strains comprehension:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 20 billion Internet of Things devices are now online.

The COVID-19 pandemic creates a further imperative to take action on these types of opportunities.</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Storytelling</h3>\n<p>Even with advanced technology that can synthesize and deliver data in actionable formats, further context and understanding is still needed.\nAs Nobel Prize winners Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, were quoted as saying in the book,&quot;The Undoing Project,&quot; by Michael Lewis,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Call it the &quot;human experience side&quot; of AI if you like.</p>\n<p>To ground us in reality and reasonable expectations, it helps to reflect on the early pioneers of behavioral economics, which is the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.\nWhat researchers in this area found was fascinating. During studies of even highly educated, scientifically disciplined doctorates in medicine and statistics, Tversky and Kahneman found most people walk around with mental heuristics (habits) including availability, representativeness, and anchoring. Their research indicated we are prone to using recent availability or representativeness of personal experience to extrapolate probability, and our expectations can be anchored by the order in which we receive information--a humbling and troubling proposition.\nTheir groundbreaking findings were published in a paper, &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases,&quot; in 1974. Today, coupled with the birth and global domination of software, we increasingly look to technology for answers to protect us from misjudgment.\nHowever, there is a bit of humor here. As the proliferation of technology solutions shown in the chart, &quot;Data and the AI Landscape&quot; on pages 24-25 further affirms, we need context and process to make the path realistic. Illustrating that resource without calibration is nearly useless, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his famous poem, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Testing the Experts</h3>\n<p>As Kahneman and Tversky found among their highly educated audience decades ago, being surrounded by numbers is not relevant if it&quot;s not digestible in our daily workflow. To underline this point, Paul Slovic, a psychologist and a peer of Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, decided to evaluate the effect of information on decision-making. He gathered a group of professional gamblers and tested them with horse races over four rounds.\nSlovic told them the test would consist of predicting 40 horse races in four consecutive rounds. In the first round, each gambler was given five pieces of information about each horse. One might believe years of jockey experience was a key performance indicator (KPI); another might want horse top speed; and so on. (Industry examples of these types of KPI calculations are shown in the chart, &quot;Business KPIs: A Universal Language,&quot; on this page.)\nIn addition to imageking winners, the experts were asked to indicate their level of confidence in their choice. In the first round with five pieces of information, they proved to be 17 percent accurate, substantially better than the 10 percent calculated chance prior to receiving their information. Their confidence was cited at 19 percent, relatively in line with the outcome.\nThey were then given 10 pieces of information in the second round and so on until they received 40 pieces of information in the final round. Interestingly, while their predictive ability flatlined at the 17% accuracy level, their confidence continued to rise with the additional information to expect a 34% hit rate!\nThis has significant ramifications for our ability to use raw information often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) and untested assumptions. Unless we have disciplined consistent process with feedback loops, we risk being guilty of simply cherry-imageking data to enhance our confirmation bias--leaving us potentially wrong and extra confident about it.</p>\n<h3>Can You OODA?</h3>\n<p>Thankfully for those with humility and a desire to drive consistent outperformance, the concept of feedback loops has become increasingly prevalent to digest and filter the mountain of data resources from noise into insight.\nThe U.S. military recognized realty is in a constant state of change (often in response to our own actions) and that excellence in process may be one of the few sustainable areas of persistent advantage. Based on this realization, strategy tactician John Boyd created a very straightforward framework called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.\nNow considered a foundational doctrine, it suggests that regardless of the backdrop, whomever is able to accurately observe (ingest data), orient (solve for KPIs), decide (designate the primary objective), and act (ability to execute) these steps and proceed back to the first step to observe success or failure of previous effort, will emerge victorious.
